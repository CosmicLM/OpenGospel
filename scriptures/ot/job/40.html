		<h1>Job Chapter 40</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MOREOVER the LORD answered Job, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, let him answer it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Then Job answered the LORD, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
	</p>
</li>
