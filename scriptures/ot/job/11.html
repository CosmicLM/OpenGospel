		<h1>Job Chapter 11</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk be justified?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
	</p>
</li>
