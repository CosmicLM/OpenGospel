		<h1>Job Chapter 30</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BUT now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul grieved for the poor?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.
	</p>
