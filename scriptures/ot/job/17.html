		<h1>Job Chapter 17</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.
	</p>
</li>
