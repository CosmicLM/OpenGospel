		<h1>Job Chapter 21</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BUT Job answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know their tokens,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him what he hath done?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?
	</p>
</li>
