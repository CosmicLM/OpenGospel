		<h1>Job Chapter 19</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN Job answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed in a book!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.
	</p>
</li>
