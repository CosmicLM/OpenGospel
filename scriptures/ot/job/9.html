		<h1>Job Chapter 9</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN Job answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto him, What doest thou?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof, if not, where, and who is he?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.
	</p>
</li>
