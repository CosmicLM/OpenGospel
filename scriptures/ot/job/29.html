		<h1>Job Chapter 29</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MOREOVER Job continued his parable, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.
	</p>
