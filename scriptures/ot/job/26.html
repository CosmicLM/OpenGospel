		<h1>Job Chapter 26</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BUT Job answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?
	</p>
