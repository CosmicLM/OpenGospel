<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert justice?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		(For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.
	</p>
