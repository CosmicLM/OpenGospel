		<h1>Job Chapter 6</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BUT Job answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox over his fodder?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there any taste in the white of an egg?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your substance?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perverse things?
	</p>
</li>
