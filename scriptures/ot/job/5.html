		<h1>Job Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		CALL now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.
	</p>
