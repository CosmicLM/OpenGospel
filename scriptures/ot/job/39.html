		<h1>Job Chapter 39</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		KNOWEST thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or will he harrow the valleys after thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his nostrils is terrible.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.
	</p>
