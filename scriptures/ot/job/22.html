		<h1>Job Chapter 22</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee into judgment?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the dark cloud?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.
	</p>
