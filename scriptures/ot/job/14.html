		<h1>Job Chapter 14</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MAN that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.
	</p>
</li>
