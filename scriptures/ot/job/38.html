		<h1>Job Chapter 38</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? declare, if thou hast understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou knowest it all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the number of thy days is great?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to the heart?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the bottles of heaven,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of the young lions,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.
	</p>
