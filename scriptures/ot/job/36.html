		<h1>Job Chapter 36</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		ELIHU also proceeded, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.
	</p>
