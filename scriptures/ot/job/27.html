		<h1>Job Chapter 27</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MOREOVER Job continued his parable, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call upon God?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.
	</p>
</li>
