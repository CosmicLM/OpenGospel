		<h1>Job Chapter 13</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		LO, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be your wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall upon you?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my transgression and my sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.
	</p>
</li>
