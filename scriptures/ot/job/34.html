		<h1>Job Chapter 34</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		FURTHERMORE Elihu answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without transgression.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposed the whole world?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.
	</p>
</li>
