		<h1>Job Chapter 10</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.
	</p>
</li>
