		<h1>Job Chapter 24</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHY, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?
	</p>
</li>
