		<h1>Job Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AFTER this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And Job spake, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should suck?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.
	</p>
</li>
