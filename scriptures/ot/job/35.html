		<h1>Job Chapter 35</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		ELIHU spake moreover, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which are higher than thou.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy righteousness may profit the son of man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the night;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty regard it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is before him; therefore trust thou in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
	</p>
