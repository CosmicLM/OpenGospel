		<h1>Job Chapter 33</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHEREFORE, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of any of his matters.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
