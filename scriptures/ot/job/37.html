		<h1>Job Chapter 37</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AT this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.
	</p>
</li>
