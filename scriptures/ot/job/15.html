		<h1>Job Chapter 15</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before the hills?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou, which is not in us?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secret thing with thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes wink at,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.
	</p>
</li>
