		<h1>Job Chapter 41</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		CANST thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Canst thou fill his skin with barbed iron? or his head with fish spears?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
	</p>
</li>
