		<h1>Job Chapter 32</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		SO these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.
	</p>
