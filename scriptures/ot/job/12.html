		<h1>Job Chapter 12</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND Job answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.
	</p>
