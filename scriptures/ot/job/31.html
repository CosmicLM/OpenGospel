		<h1>Job Chapter 31</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For what portion of God is there from above? and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one fashion us in the womb?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		(For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh! we cannot be satisfied.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley. The words of Job are ended.
	</p>
</li>
