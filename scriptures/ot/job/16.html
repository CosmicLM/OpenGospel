		<h1>Job Chapter 16</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN Job answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.
	</p>
</li>
