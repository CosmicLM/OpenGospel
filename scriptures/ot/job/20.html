		<h1>Job Chapter 20</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.
	</p>
