		<h1>Job Chapter 4</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himself from speaking?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his maker?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die, even without wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
