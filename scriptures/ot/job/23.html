		<h1>Job Chapter 23</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN Job answered and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even to his seat!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he would put strength in me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.
	</p>
