		<h1>Job Chapter 7</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		IS there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his days also like the days of an hireling?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
	</p>
</li>
