		<h1>Job Chapter 18</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.
	</p>
