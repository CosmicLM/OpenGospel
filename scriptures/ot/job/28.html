		<h1>Job Chapter 28</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		SURELY there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of understanding?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of understanding?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
	</p>
