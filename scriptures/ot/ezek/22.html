		<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 22</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MOREOVER the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee? I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.
	</p>
