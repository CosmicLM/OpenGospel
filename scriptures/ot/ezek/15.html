		<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 15</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Son of man, What is the vine tree more than any tree, or than a branch which is among the trees of the forest?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Shall wood be taken thereof to do any work? or will men take a pin of it to hang any vessel thereon?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Behold, it is cast into the fire for fuel; the fire devoureth both the ends of it, and the midst of it is burned. Is it meet for any work?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Behold, when it was whole, it was meet for no work: how much less shall it be meet yet for any work, when the fire hath devoured it, and it is burned?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; As the vine tree among the trees of the forest, which I have given to the fire for fuel, so will I give the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And I will make the land desolate, because they have committed a trespass, saith the Lord GOD.
	</p>
</li>
