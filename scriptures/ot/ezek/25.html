		<h1>Ezekiel Chapter 25</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Son of man, set thy face against the Ammonites, and prophesy against them;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And say unto the Ammonites, Hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou saidst, Aha, against my sanctuary, when it was profaned; and against the land of Israel, when it was desolate; and against the house of Judah, when they went into captivity;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Behold, therefore I will deliver thee to the men of the east for a possession, and they shall set their palaces in thee, and make their dwellings in thee: they shall eat thy fruit, and they shall drink thy milk.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And I will make Rabbah a stable for camels, and the Ammonites a couchingplace for flocks: and ye shall know that I am the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For thus saith the Lord GOD; Because thou hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with the feet, and rejoiced in heart with all thy despite against the land of Israel;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Behold, therefore I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and will deliver thee for a spoil to the heathen; and I will cut thee off from the people, and I will cause thee to perish out of the countries: I will destroy thee; and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Moab and Seir do say, Behold, the house of Judah is like unto all the heathen;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Therefore, behold, I will open the side of Moab from the cities, from his cities which are on his frontiers, the glory of the country, Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Unto the men of the east with the Ammonites, and will give them in possession, that the Ammonites may not be remembered among the nations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And I will execute judgments upon Moab; and they shall know that I am the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because that Edom hath dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and hath greatly offended, and revenged himself upon them;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; I will also stretch out mine hand upon Edom, and will cut off man and beast from it; and I will make it desolate from Teman; and they of Dedan shall fall by the sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall do in Edom according to mine anger and according to my fury; and they shall know my vengeance, saith the Lord GOD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Thus saith the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out mine hand upon the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And I will execute great vengeance upon them with furious rebukes; and they shall know that I am the LORD, when I shall lay my vengeance upon them.
	</p>
