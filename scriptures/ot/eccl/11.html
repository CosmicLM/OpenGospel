		<h1>Ecclesiastes Chapter 11</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		CAST thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after many days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the eyes to behold the sun:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that cometh is vanity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for all these things God will bring thee into judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.
	</p>
</li>
