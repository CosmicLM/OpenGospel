		<h1>Ecclesiastes Chapter 10</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		DEAD flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a fool.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error which proceedeth from the ruler:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a babbler is no better.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of a fool will swallow up himself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and the end of his talk is mischievous madness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be; and what shall be after him, who can tell him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because he knoweth not how to go to the city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes eat in the morning!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles, and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for drunkenness!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money answereth all things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.
	</p>
