		<h1>Ecclesiastes Chapter 7</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		A GOOD name is better than precious ointment; and the day of death than the day of one's birth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the living will lay it to his heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart is made better.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter of the fool: this also is vanity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth the heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in the bosom of fools.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning this.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit to them that see the sun.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them that have it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight, which he hath made crooked?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise: why shouldest thou destroy thyself?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why shouldest thou die before thy time?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God shall come forth of them all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which are in the city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and sinneth not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou hear thy servant curse thee:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself likewise hast cursed others.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it out?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness of folly, even of foolishness and madness:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by one, to find out the account:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not found.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright; but they have sought out many inventions.
	</p>
