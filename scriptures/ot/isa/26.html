		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 26</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		IN that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is everlasting strength:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost weigh the path of the just.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will learn righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea, the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast wrought all our works in us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, and made all their memory to perish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto all the ends of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.
	</p>
</li>
