		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 44</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		YET now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and my blessing upon thine offspring:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the water courses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside me there is no God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen, they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed together.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he drinketh no water, and is faint.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man, according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak, which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof, and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea, he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven image, and falleth down thereto.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the fire:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot understand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a tree?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside, that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie in my right hand?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt not be forgotten of me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and, as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by myself;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their knowledge foolish;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built; and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.
	</p>
