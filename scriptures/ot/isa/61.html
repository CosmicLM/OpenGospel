		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 61</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he might be glorified.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities, the desolations of many generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring among the people: all that see them shall acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath blessed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all the nations.
