		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 64</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		OH that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be saved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are laid waste.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?
	</p>
</li>
