		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 21</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.
	</p>
