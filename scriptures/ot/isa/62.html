		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 62</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		FOR Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that burneth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of the LORD shall name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of the LORD, keep not silence,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in the courts of my holiness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones; lift up a standard for the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh; behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not forsaken.
	</p>
</li>
