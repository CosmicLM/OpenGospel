		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 25</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		O LORD, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old are faithfulness and truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be built.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of the terrible nations shall fear thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD hath spoken it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down for the dunghill.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.
	</p>
