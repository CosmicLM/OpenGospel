		<h1>Isaiah Chapter 35</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and save you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and streams in the desert.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though fools, shall not err therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall walk there:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.
	</p>
</li>
