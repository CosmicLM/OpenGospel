		<h1>Zechariah Chapter 2</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I LIFTED up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.
