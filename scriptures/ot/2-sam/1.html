		<h1>2 Samuel Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		NOW it came to pass after the death of Saul, when David was returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, and David had abode two days in Ziklag;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		It came even to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came out of the camp from Saul with his clothes rent, and earth upon his head: and so it was, when he came to David, that he fell to the earth, and did obeisance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And David said unto him, From whence comest thou? And he said unto him, Out of the camp of Israel am I escaped.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And David said unto him, How went the matter? I pray thee, tell me. And he answered, That the people are fled from the battle, and many of the people also are fallen and dead; and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead also.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And David said unto the young man that told him, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son be dead?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And the young man that told him said, As I happened by chance upon mount Gilboa, behold, Saul leaned upon his spear; and, lo, the chariots and horsemen followed hard after him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called unto me. And I answered, Here am I.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And he said unto me, Who art thou? And I answered him, I am an Amalekite.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And he said unto me again, Stand, I pray thee, upon me, and slay me: for anguish is come upon me, because my life is yet whole in me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		So I stood upon him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after that he was fallen: and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was on his arm, and have brought them hither unto my lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Then David took hold on his clothes, and rent them; and likewise all the men that were with him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And David said unto the young man that told him, Whence art thou? And he answered, I am the son of a stranger, an Amalekite.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And David said unto him, How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the LORD's anointed?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And David called one of the young men, and said, Go near, and fall upon him. And he smote him that he died.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And David said unto him, Thy blood be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the LORD's anointed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		(Also he bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow: behold, it is written in the book of Jasher.)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The beauty of Israel is slain upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Askelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew, neither let there be rain, upon you, nor fields of offerings: for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, as though he had not been anointed with oil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you in scarlet, with other delights, who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, thou wast slain in thine high places.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan: very pleasant hast thou been unto me: thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
	</p>
</li>
