<li name="1">
	<p>
		GIVE ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the prayer of thy people?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tears to drink in great measure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies laugh among themselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen, and planted it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deep root, and it filled the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto the river.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call upon thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved.
