<li name="1">
	<p>
		O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
	</p>
</li>
