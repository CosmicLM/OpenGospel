		<h1>Psalms Chapter 89</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I WILL sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or to thy faithfulness round about thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrath burn like fire?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
	</p>
