		<h1>Psalms Chapter 63</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		O GOD, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands in thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.
	</p>
</li>
