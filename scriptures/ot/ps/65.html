<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRAISE waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
	</p>
