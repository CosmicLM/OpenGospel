		SING aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>

	</p>

<li name="5">
	<p>
		This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
