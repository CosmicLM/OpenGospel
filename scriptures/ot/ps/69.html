		<h1>Psalms Chapter 69</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		SAVE me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I made sackcloth also my garment; and I become a proverb to them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moveth therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.
	</p>
