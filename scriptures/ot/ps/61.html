<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the covert of thy wings. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the heritage of those that fear thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth, which may preserve him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
