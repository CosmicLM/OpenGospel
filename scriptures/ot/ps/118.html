		I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.

		All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
	</p>

<li name="12">
	<p>
		They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.
	</p>

<li name="14">
	<p>
		The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
	</p>

	<p>
		The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

	<p>
		The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.
	</p>

<li name="19">
	<p>
		Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.

	<p>
		The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.

	<p>
		This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.
