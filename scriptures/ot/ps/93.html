<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

<li name="3">
	<p>
		The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up their voice; the floods lift up their waves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, O LORD, for ever.
