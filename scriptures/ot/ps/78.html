		<h1>Psalms Chapter 78</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		GIVE ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="53">
	<p>
		And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="54">
	<p>
		And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="55">
	<p>
		He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="56">
	<p>
		Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="57">
	<p>
		But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="58">
	<p>
		For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="59">
	<p>
		When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="60">
	<p>
		So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="61">
	<p>
		And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="62">
	<p>
		He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="63">
	<p>
		The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="64">
	<p>
		Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="65">
	<p>
		Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="66">
	<p>
		And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="67">
	<p>
		Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="68">
	<p>
		But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="69">
	<p>
		And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="70">
	<p>
		He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="71">
	<p>
		From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="72">
	<p>
		So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
