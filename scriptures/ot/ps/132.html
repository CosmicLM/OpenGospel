	<p>
		LORD, remember David, and all his afflictions:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of Jacob;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go up into my bed;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of the wood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his footstool.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy saints shout for joy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor with bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints shall shout aloud for joy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a lamp for mine anointed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall his crown flourish.
	</p>
