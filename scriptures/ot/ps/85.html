		<h1>Psalms Chapter 85</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		LORD, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast brought back the captivity of Jacob.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast covered all their sin. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself from the fierceness of thine anger.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again to folly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way of his steps.
	</p>
