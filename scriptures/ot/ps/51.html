		<h1>Psalms Chapter 51</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HAVE mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.
	</p>
