		<h1>Psalms Chapter 86</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BOW down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servant that trusteth in thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt answer me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God alone.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my heart to fear thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I will glorify thy name for evermore.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee before them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it, and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
	</p>
