<li name="1">
	<p>
		MAKE haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say, Aha, aha.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
