		LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they that rise up against me.
	</p>

<li name="2">
	<p>
		Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.

	<p>
		But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

<li name="6">
	<p>
		I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me round about.

<li name="7">
	<p>
		Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.

<li name="8">
	<p>
		Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
