	<p>
		NOT unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
