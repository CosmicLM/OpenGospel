		<h1>Psalms Chapter 74</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		O GOD, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.
	</p>
