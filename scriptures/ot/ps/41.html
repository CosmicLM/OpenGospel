	<p>
		BLESSED is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and nowthat he lieth he shall rise up no more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
