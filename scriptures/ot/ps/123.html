		<h1>Psalms Chapter 123</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		UNTO thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
