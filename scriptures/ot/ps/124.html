	<p>
		IF it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israel say;
	</p>

<li name="2">
	<p>
		If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose up against us:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

<li name="6">
	<p>
		Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.
	</p>

<li name="7">
	<p>
		Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

<li name="8">
	<p>
		Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
