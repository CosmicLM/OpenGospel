<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.
