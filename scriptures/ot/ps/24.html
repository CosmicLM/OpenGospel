<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand in his holy place?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob. Selah.
	</p>

<li name="7">
	<p>
		Lift up your head, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory. Selah.
