	<p>
		THEY that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is round about his people from henceforth even for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
