		<h1>Psalms Chapter 92</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		IT is a good thing to give thanks unto the LORD, and to sing praises unto thy name, O most High:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will triumph in the works of thy hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I shall be anointed with fresh oil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish in the courts of our God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
	</p>
