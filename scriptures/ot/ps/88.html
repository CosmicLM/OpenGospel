		<h1>Psalms Chapter 88</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		O LORD God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before thee:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness in the land of forgetfulness?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine acquaintance into darkness.
	</p>
</li>
