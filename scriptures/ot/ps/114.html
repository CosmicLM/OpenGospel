		<h1>Psalms Chapter 114</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHEN Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like lambs.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters.
	</p>
