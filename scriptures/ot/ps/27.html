		<h1>Psalms Chapter 27</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me, and answer me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, LORD, will I seek.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of my salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will take me up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because of mine enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of the LORD in the land of the living.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
	</p>
