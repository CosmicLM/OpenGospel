		<h1>Psalms Chapter 135</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRAISE ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him, O ye servants of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the house of our God,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above all gods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of his treasuries.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD, throughout all generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that trusteth in them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of Aaron:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
	</p>
