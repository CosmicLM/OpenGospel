		<h1>Psalms Chapter 53</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
