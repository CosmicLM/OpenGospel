		UNTO thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

	<p>
		When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

	<p>
		The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

	<p>
		I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:

	<p>
		Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.

		For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.

		But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up another.

</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them.
	</p>

	<p>
		But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.

	<p>
		All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
