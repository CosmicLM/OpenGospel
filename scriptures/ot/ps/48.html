<li name="1">
	<p>
		GREAT is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad, because of thy judgments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may tell it to the generation following.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide even unto death.
	</p>
