		<h1>Psalms Chapter 66</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MAKE a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.
	</p>
