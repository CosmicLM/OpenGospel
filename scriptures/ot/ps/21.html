<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.
	</p>
