		<h1>Psalms Chapter 73</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		TRULY God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are utterly consumed with terrors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
	</p>
</li>
