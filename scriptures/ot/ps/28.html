		<h1>Psalms Chapter 28</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.
	</p>
