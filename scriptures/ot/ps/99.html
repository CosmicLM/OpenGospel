		THE LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

	<p>
		Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

		The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.

	<p>
		Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.

	<p>
		Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.

<li name="9">
	<p>
		Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the LORD our God is holy.
