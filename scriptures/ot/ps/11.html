		<h1>Psalms Chapter 11</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		IN the LORD put I my trust: How say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
	</p>
