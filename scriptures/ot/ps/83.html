		<h1>Psalms Chapter 83</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		KEEP not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Which perished at En-dor: they became as dung for the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.
	</p>
