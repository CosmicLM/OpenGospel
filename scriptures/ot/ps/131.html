		<h1>Psalms Chapter 131</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		LORD, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
	</p>
