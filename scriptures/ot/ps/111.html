<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRAISE ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is gracious and full of compassion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be mindful of his covenant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may give them the heritage of the heathen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good understanding have all they that do his commandments: his praise endureth for ever.
