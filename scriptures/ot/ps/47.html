		O CLAP your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.

		For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth.
	</p>

	<p>
		He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our feet.

	<p>
		He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

		God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.

	<p>
		The princes of the people are gathered together, even the people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.
