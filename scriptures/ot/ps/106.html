		<h1>Psalms Chapter 106</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRAISE ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth all his praise?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
