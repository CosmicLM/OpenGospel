		<h1>Psalms Chapter 101</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I WILL sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I sing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked person.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
	</p>
