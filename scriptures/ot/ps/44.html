		<h1>Psalms Chapter 44</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
	</p>
</li>
