<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRAISE ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens: praise him in the heights.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and they were created.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a decree which shall not pass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Fire, and hail; snow, and vapour; stormy wind fulfilling his word:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
