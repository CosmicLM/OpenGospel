	<p>
		THE LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of isles be glad thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and trembled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see his glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted far above all gods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
