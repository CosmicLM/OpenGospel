		I WAS glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.

	<p>
		Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
	</p>

<li name="4">
	<p>
		Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David.
	</p>

	<p>
		Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee.

	<p>
		Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

	<p>
		For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee.

	<p>
		Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
