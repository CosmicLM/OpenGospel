		<h1>Psalms Chapter 55</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		GIVE ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.
	</p>
