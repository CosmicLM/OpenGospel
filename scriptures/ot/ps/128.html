	<p>
		BLESSED is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

<li name="6">
	<p>
		Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
