	<p>
		WHY do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
