		I WILL extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
	</p>

<li name="3">
	<p>
		Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall declare thy mighty acts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy wondrous works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I will declare thy greatness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger, and of great mercy.
	</p>

	<p>
		The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works.
	</p>

	<p>
		All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall bless thee.
	</p>

<li name="11">
	<p>
		They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those that be bowed down.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meat in due season.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will hear their cry, and will save them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked will he destroy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
