		<h1>Psalms Chapter 90</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.
	</p>
</li>
