	<p>
		OUT of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I hope.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
