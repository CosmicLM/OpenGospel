<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRAISE ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.
