		<h1>Psalms Chapter 58</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		DO ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
	</p>
</li>
