<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
	</p>
