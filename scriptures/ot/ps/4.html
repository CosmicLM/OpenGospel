		<h1>Psalms Chapter 4</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
