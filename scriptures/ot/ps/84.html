	<p>
		HOW amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still praising thee. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
