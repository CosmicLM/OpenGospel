<li name="1">
	<p>
		HE that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
	</p>
