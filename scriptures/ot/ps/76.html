<li name="1">
	<p>
		IN Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and none of the men of might have found their hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared, and was still,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the kings of the earth.
