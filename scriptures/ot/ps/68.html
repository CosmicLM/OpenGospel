		<h1>Psalms Chapter 68</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		LET God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God.
