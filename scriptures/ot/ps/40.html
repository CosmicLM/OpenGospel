		<h1>Psalms Chapter 40</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I WAITED patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is written of me,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
	</p>
