		<h1>Psalms Chapter 105</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praise ye the LORD.
	</p>
