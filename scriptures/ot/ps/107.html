		<h1>Psalms Chapter 107</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
