<li name="1">
	<p>
		JUDGE me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked in thy truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with dissemblers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit with the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine altar, O LORD:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of all thy wondrous works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and be merciful unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I bless the LORD.
	</p>
