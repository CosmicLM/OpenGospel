		<h1>Psalms Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BLESSED is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
