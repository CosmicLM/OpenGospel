<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRAISE ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the upright shall be blessed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness endureth for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his affairs with discretion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed, trusting in the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
