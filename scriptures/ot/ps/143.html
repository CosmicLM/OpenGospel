		<h1>Psalms Chapter 143</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight shall no man living be justified.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hide me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is good; lead me into the land of uprightness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
	</p>
