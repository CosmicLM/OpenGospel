	<p>
		THE LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
