		<h1>Psalms Chapter 72</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		GIVE the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
	</p>
