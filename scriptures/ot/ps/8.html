	<p>
		O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
