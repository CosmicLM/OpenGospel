		GIVE unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
	</p>

<li name="2">
	<p>
		Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness.

		The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.

<li name="4">
	<p>
		The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is full of majesty.

	<p>
		The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

	<p>
		The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.
	</p>

<li name="10">
	<p>
		The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King for ever.

	<p>
		The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will bless his people with peace.
