		<h1>Psalms Chapter 36</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we see light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thy righteousness to the upright in heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the hand of the wicked remove me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise.
	</p>
