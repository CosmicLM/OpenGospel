		<h1>Psalms Chapter 59</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		DELIVER me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.
	</p>
