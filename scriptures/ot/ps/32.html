		<h1>Psalms Chapter 32</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		BLESSED is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is turned into the drought of summer. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters they shall not come nigh unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble; thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.
	</p>
