	<p>
		O COME, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.
