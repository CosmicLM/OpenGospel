		<h1>Psalms Chapter 64</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear of the enemy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they shoot at him, and fear not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: all that see them shall flee away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
	</p>
</li>
