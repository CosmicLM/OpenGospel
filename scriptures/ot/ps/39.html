		<h1>Psalms Chapter 39</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
	</p>
