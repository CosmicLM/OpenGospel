	<p>
		O SING unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation from day to day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be feared above all gods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made the heavens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in his sanctuary.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the LORD glory and strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an offering, and come into his courts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him, all the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people righteously.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall all the trees of the wood rejoice
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the people with his truth.
