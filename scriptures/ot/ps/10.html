		<h1>Psalms Chapter 10</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHY standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
	</p>
</li>
