		<h1>Psalms Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		GIVE ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
	</p>
</li>
