		<h1>Psalms Chapter 104</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BLESS the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
	</p>
