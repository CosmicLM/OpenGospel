<li name="1">
	<p>
		UNTO thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
	</p>
