		<h1>Psalms Chapter 49</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		(For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.
	</p>
</li>
