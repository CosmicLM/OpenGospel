<li name="1">
	<p>
		HELP, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud things:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own: who is lord over us?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
