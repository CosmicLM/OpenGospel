		<h1>Psalms Chapter 71</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		IN thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.
	</p>
</li>
