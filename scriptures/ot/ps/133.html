	<p>
		BEHOLD, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts of his garments;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.
