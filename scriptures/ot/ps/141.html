		<h1>Psalms Chapter 141</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		LORD, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my voice, when I cry unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the gins of the workers of iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal escape.
	</p>
