		<h1>Psalms Chapter 45</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
	</p>
</li>
