	<p>
		I WILL extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the remembrance of his holiness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life: weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
