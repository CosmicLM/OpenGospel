		<h1>Psalms Chapter 9</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I WILL praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men. Selah.
