		<h1>Psalms Chapter 50</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.
	</p>
</li>
