		<h1>Psalms Chapter 33</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD: and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
	</p>
