	<p>
		How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the wicked? Selah.
	</p>

	<p>
		Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy.
	</p>

<li name="4">
	<p>
		Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the wicked.
	</p>

<li name="5">
	<p>
		They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

	<p>
		I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.
