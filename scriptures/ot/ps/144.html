	<p>
		BLESSED be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.
