<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRAISE ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto my God while I have any being.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is: which keepeth truth for ever:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
