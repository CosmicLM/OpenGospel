<li name="1">
	<p>
		I LOVE the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee, deliver my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helped me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt bountifully with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I said in my haste, All men are liars.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will call upon the name of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all his people,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
