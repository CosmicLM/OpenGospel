<li name="1">
	<p>
		TRULY my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.
