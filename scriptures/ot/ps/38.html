		<h1>Psalms Chapter 38</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
	</p>
</li>
