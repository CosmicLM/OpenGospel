	<p>
		BY the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
	</p>

<li name="9">
	<p>
		Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.
