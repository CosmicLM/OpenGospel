		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHEN the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done great things for them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
