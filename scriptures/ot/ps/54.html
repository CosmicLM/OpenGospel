	<p>
		SAVE me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O LORD; for it is good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies.
