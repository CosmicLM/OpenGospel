	<p>
		THE LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God of Jacob defend thee;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of Zion;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice; Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel.
	</p>

<li name="5">
	<p>
		We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.

<li name="8">
	<p>
		They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand upright.

	<p>
		Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
