		<h1>Psalms Chapter 37</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		FRET not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
	</p>
