<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRAISE ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise in the congregation of saints.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of Zion be joyful in their King.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify the meek with salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon their beds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a twoedged sword in their hand;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.
