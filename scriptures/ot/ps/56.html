<li name="1">
	<p>
		BE merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against me for evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle: are they not in thy book?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this I know; for God is for me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can do unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
