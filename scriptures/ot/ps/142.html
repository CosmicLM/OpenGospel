		<h1>Psalms Chapter 142</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I CRIED unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORD did I make my supplication.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.
	</p>
