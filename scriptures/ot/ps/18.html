		<h1>Psalms Chapter 18</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		I WILL love thee, O LORD, my strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
