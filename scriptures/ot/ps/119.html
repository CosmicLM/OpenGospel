	<p>

	<p>
		Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.
	</p>

<li name="22">
	<p>
		Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.
	</p>
</li>

	<p>
		Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.
	</p>
</li>

	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>

	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>

	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>

	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="53">
	<p>
		Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="54">
	<p>
		Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="55">
	<p>
		I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="56">
	<p>
		This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="57">
	<p>
		Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="58">
	<p>
		I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="59">
	<p>
		I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="60">
	<p>
		I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="61">
	<p>
		The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="62">
	<p>
		At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="63">
	<p>
		I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="64">
	<p>
		The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="65">
	<p>
		Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="66">
	<p>
		Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="67">
	<p>
		Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="68">
	<p>
		Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="69">
	<p>
		The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="70">
	<p>
		Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="71">
	<p>
		It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="72">
	<p>
		The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="73">
	<p>
		Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="74">
	<p>
		They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="75">
	<p>
		I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="76">
	<p>
		Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="77">
	<p>
		Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="78">
	<p>
		Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="79">
	<p>
		Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="80">
	<p>
		Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="81">
	<p>
		My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="82">
	<p>
		Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="83">
	<p>
		For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="84">
	<p>
		How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="85">
	<p>
		The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="86">
	<p>
		All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="87">
	<p>
		They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="88">
	<p>
		Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="89">
	<p>
		For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="90">
	<p>
		Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="91">
	<p>
		They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="92">
	<p>
		Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="93">
	<p>
		I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="94">
	<p>
		I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="95">
	<p>
		The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="96">
	<p>
		I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="97">
	<p>
		O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="98">
	<p>
		Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="99">
	<p>
		I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="100">
	<p>
		I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="101">
	<p>
		I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="102">
	<p>
		I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="103">
	<p>
		How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="104">
	<p>
		Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="105">
	<p>
		Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="106">
	<p>
		I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="107">
	<p>
		I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="108">
	<p>
		Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="109">
	<p>
		My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="110">
	<p>
		The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="111">
	<p>
		Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="112">
	<p>

<li name="113">
	<p>

	<p>
		Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="115">
	<p>
		Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="116">
	<p>
		Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.
	</p>

<li name="117">
	<p>
		Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="118">
	<p>
		Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="119">
	<p>
		Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="120">
	<p>
		My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="121">
	<p>
		I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="122">
	<p>
		Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.
	</p>

		I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="126">
	<p>
		It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.
