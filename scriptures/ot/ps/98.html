	<p>
		O SING unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
