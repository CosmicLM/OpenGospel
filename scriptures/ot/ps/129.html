		Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they have not prevailed against me.

		The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

		The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the wicked.

		Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

	<p>
		Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.

		Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
