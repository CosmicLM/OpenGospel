		THE LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.

	<p>
		The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.

<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dew of thy youth.
	</p>

<li name="4">
	<p>
		The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

<li name="6">
	<p>
		He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.

	<p>
		He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he lift up the head.
