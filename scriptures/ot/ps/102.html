		<h1>Psalms Chapter 102</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.
	</p>
</li>
