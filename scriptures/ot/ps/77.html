		<h1>Psalms Chapter 77</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		I CRIED unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
	</p>
</li>
