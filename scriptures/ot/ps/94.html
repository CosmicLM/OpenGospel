<li name="1">
	<p>
		O LORD God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to the proud.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the workers of iniquity boast themselves?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine heritage.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when will ye be wise?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the eye, shall he not see?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest him out of thy law;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, until the pit be digged for the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the upright in heart shall follow it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut them off.
	</p>
