		<h1>Psalms Chapter 140</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		DELIVER me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the violent man;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my supplications, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast covered my head in the day of battle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted, and the right of the poor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the upright shall dwell in thy presence.
	</p>
