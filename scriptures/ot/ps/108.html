	<p>
		O GOD, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even with my glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above all the earth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, and answer me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over Philistia will I triumph.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
