		<h1>Psalms Chapter 14</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy: there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of the righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is his refuge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
