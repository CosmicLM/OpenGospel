		<h1>Psalms Chapter 103</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BLESS the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.
	</p>
