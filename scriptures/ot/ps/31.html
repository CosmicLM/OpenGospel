		<h1>Psalms Chapter 31</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		IN thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
