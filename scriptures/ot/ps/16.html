<li name="1">
	<p>
		PRESERVE me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thou maintainest my lot.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins also instruct me in the night seasons.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
	</p>
