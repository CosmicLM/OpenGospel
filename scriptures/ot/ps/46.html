<li name="1">
	<p>
		GOD is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice, the earth melted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath made in the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot in the fire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. Selah.
