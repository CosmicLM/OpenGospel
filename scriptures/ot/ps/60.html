	<p>
		O GOD, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall tread down our enemies.
