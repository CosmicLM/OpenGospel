		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 18</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THROUGH desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.
	</p>
</li>
