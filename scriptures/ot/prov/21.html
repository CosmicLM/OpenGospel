		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 21</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.
