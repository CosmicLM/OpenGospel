<li name="1">
	<p>
		HE, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.
