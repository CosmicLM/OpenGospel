		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 16</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of the bag are his work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.
	</p>
