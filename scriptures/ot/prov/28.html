		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 28</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
	</p>
