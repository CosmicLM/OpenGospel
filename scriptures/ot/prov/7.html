		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 7</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		(She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.
	</p>
</li>
