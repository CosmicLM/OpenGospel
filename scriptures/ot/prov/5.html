		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
	</p>
</li>
