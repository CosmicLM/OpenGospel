		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 10</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.
