		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 2</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
	</p>
