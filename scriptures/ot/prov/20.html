		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 20</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WINE is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.
	</p>
