		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 27</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BOAST not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Open rebuke is better than secret love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.
	</p>
