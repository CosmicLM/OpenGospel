		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 19</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BETTER is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.
	</p>
