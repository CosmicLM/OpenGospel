		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary of his correction:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop down the dew.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot from being taken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is with the righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of fools.
	</p>
</li>
