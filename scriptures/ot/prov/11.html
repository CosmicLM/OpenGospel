		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 11</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		A FALSE balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.
	</p>
