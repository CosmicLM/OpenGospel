		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 6</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy neck.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
	</p>
