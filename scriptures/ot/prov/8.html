		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 8</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		DOTH not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
	</p>
