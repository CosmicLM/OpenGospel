		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 17</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BETTER is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.
	</p>
</li>
