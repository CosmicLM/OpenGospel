		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 31</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.
	</p>
