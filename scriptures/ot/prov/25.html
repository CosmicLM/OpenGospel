		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 25</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THESE are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.
	</p>
</li>
