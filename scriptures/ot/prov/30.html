		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 30</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their eyelids are lifted up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.
	</p>
</li>
