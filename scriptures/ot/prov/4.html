		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 4</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
	</p>
</li>
