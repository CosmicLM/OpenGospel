		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 9</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WISDOM hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		A foolish woman is clamourous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		To call passengers who go right on their ways:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.
	</p>
</li>
