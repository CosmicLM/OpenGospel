		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 23</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHEN thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently what is before thee:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to appetite.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither desire thou his dainty meats:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink, saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose thy sweet words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the words of knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even mine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of the LORD all the day long.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be cut off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mother when she is old.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction, and understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow pit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the transgressors among men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of eyes?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed wine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an adder.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick; they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I will seek it yet again.
	</p>
