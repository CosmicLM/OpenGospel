		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 14</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		EVERY wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.
	</p>
