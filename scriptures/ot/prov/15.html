		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 15</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		A SOFT answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.
	</p>
