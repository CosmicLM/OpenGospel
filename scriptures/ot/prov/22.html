		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 22</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.
	</p>
