		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and equity;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools despise wisdom and instruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
	</p>
