		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 13</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		A WISE son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.
	</p>
