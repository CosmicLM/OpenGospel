		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 26</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AS snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.
	</p>
</li>
