		<h1>Proverbs Chapter 12</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHOSO loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.
	</p>
