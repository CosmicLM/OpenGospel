		<h1>Micah Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces, as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them: he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they have behaved themselves ill in their doings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and pervert all equity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among us? none evil can come upon us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest.
	</p>
