<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering: of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And this is the offering which ye shall take of them; gold, and silver, and brass,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and shittim wood,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Oil for the light, spices for anointing oil, and for sweet incense,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Onyx stones, and stones to be set in the ephod, and in the breastplate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		According to all that I shew thee, after the pattern of the tabernacle, and the pattern of all the instruments thereof, even so shall ye make it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, within and without shalt thou overlay it, and shalt make upon it a crown of gold round about.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And thou shalt cast four rings of gold for it, and put them in the four corners thereof; and two rings shall be in the one side of it, and two rings in the other side of it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And thou shalt put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark, that the ark may be borne with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The staves shall be in the rings of the ark: they shall not be taken from it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And thou shalt put into the ark the testimony which I shall give thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make a mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make two cherubims of gold, of beaten work shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the mercy seat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And make one cherub on the one end, and the other cherub on the other end: even of the mercy seat shall ye make the cherubims on the two ends thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And the cherubims shall stretch forth their wings on high, covering the mercy seat with their wings, and their faces shall look one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubims be.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And thou shalt put the mercy seat above upon the ark; and in the ark thou shalt put the testimony that I shall give thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And there I will meet with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubims which are upon the ark of the testimony, of all things which I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Thou shalt also make a table of shittim wood: two cubits shall be the length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And thou shalt overlay it with pure gold, and make thereto a crown of gold round about.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make unto it a border of an hand breadth round about, and thou shalt make a golden crown to the border thereof round about.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make for it four rings of gold, and put the rings in the four corners that are on the four feet thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Over against the border shall the rings be for places of the staves to bear the table.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make the staves of shittim wood, and overlay them with gold, that the table may be borne with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make the dishes thereof, and spoons thereof, and covers thereof, and bowls thereof, to cover withal: of pure gold shalt thou make them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And thou shalt set upon the table shewbread before me alway.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make a candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work shall the candlestick be made: his shaft, and his branches, his bowls, his knops, and his flowers, shall be of the same.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And six branches shall come out of the sides of it; three branches of the candlestick out of the one side, and three branches of the candlestick out of the other side:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Three bowls made like unto almonds, with a knop and a flower in one branch; and three bowls made like almonds in the other branch, with a knop and a flower: so in the six branches that come out of the candlestick.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		And in the candlestick shall be four bowls made like unto almonds, with their knops and their flowers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		And there shall be a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the same, according to the six branches that proceed out of the candlestick.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Their knops and their branches shall be of the same: all it shall be one beaten work of pure gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make the seven lamps thereof: and they shall light the lamps thereof, that they may give light over against it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		And the tongs thereof, and the snuffdishes thereof, shall be of pure gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Of a talent of pure gold shall he make it, with all these vessels.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.
