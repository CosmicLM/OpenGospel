	<p>
		And the remnant that remaineth of the curtains of the tent, the half curtain that remaineth, shall hang over the backside of the tabernacle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And a cubit on the one side, and a cubit on the other side of that which remaineth in the length of the curtains of the tent, it shall hang over the sides of the tabernacle on this side and on that side, to cover it.

	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And thou shalt make the boards for the tabernacle, twenty boards on the south side southward.
	</p>

	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And they shall be coupled together beneath, and they shall be coupled together above the head of it unto one ring: thus shall it be for them both; they shall be for the two corners.

	<p>
		And the middle bar in the midst of the boards shall reach from end to end.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And thou shalt overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings of gold for places for the bars: and thou shalt overlay the bars with gold.

	<p>
		And thou shalt rear up the tabernacle according to the fashion thereof which was shewed thee in the mount.
	</p>
</li>

	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And thou shalt hang up the vail under the taches, that thou mayest bring in thither within the vail the ark of the testimony: and the vail shall divide unto you between the holy place and the most holy.
