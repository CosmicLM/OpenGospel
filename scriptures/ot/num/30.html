		<h1>Numbers Chapter 30</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a bond, being in her father's house in her youth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her father disallowed her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it; then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced, wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond with an oath;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall forgive her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds, which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his peace at her in the day that he heard them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between the father and his daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.
