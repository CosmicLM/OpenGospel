	<p>
		Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the sum of them among the children of Israel:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="53">
	<p>
		But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="54">
	<p>
		And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.
