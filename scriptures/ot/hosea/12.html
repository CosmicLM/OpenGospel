		<h1>Hosea Chapter 12</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		EPHRAIM feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he recompense him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and made supplication unto him: he found him in Beth-el, and there he spake with us;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loveth to oppress.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in me that were sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the solemn feast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the prophets.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps in the furrows of the fields.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet was he preserved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his Lord return unto him.
