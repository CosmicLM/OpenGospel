		<h1>Hosea Chapter 4</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are as they that strive with the priest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I will also forget thy children.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore will I change their glory into shame.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off to take heed to the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots: therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Beth-aven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD will feed them as a lamb in a large place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually: her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
	</p>
</li>
