		<h1>Hosea Chapter 8</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		SET the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall pursue him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes, and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they made them idols, that they may be cut off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them: how long will it be ere they attain to innocency?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind: it hath no stalk: the bud shall yield no meal: if so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself: Ephraim hath hired lovers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to Egypt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.
	</p>
</li>
