		<h1>Hosea Chapter 6</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		COME, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
