		<h1>Amos Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HEAR ye this word which I take up against you, even a lamentation, O house of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me, and ye shall live:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But seek not Beth-el, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beer-sheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Beth-el shall come to nought.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Beth-el.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness in the earth,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his name:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the spoiled shall come against the fortress.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him that speaketh uprightly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins: they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside the poor in the gate from their right.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it is an evil time.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD, the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the Lord, saith thus; Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through thee, saith the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not hear the melody of thy viols.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.
	</p>
</li>
