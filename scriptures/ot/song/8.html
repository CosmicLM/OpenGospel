		<h1>Solomon's Song Chapter 8</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		O THAT thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that bare thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most vehement flame.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon, must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof two hundred.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice: cause me to hear it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
	</p>
</li>
