		<h1>Solomon's Song Chapter 4</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BEHOLD, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all spices!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like the smell of Lebanon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams from Lebanon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.
	</p>
</li>
