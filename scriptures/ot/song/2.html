		<h1>Solomon's Song Chapter 2</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I AM the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth embrace me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing himself through the lattice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our land;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.
	</p>
</li>
