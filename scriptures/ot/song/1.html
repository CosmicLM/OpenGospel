		<h1>Solomon's Song Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE song of songs, which is Solomon's.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.
	</p>
</li>
