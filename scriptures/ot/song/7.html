		<h1>Solomon's Song Chapter 7</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		HOW beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.
	</p>
</li>
