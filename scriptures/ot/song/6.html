		<h1>Solomon's Song Chapter 6</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHITHER is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.
