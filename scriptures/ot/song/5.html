		<h1>Solomon's Song Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I AM come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
