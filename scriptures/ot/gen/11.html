		AND the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and burn them throughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for morter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which the children of men builded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the earth.

		These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:

		Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		But Sarai was barren; she had no child.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and dwelt there.

</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.
