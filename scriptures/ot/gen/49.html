		<h1>Genesis Chapter 49</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in the last days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and hearken unto Israel your father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of power:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in their habitations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a wall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children shall bow down before thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion; who shall rouse him up?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the gathering of the people be.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant unto tribute.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the last.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well; whose branches run over the wall:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and hated him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the breasts, and of the womb:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one according to his blessing he blessed them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a buryingplace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was from the children of Heth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost, and was gathered unto his people.
