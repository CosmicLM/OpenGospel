	<p>
		AND Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and kissed him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians mourned for him threescore and ten days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my father, and I will come again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he made thee swear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it was a very great company.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called Abel-mizraim, which is beyond Jordan.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried his father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead, they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did command before he died, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they spake unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and they said, Behold, we be thy servants.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of God?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up upon Joseph's knees.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from hence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.
