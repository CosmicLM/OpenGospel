		THEN again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian, and Ishbak, and Shuah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had, Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is before Mamre;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahai-roi.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names, according to their generations: the firstborn of Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to their nations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of all his brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham begat Isaac:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padan-aram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And the children struggled together within her; and she said, If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and the elder shall serve the younger.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebekah loved Jacob.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he was faint:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called Edom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him: and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau despised his birthright.
