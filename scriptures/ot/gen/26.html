		<h1>Genesis Chapter 26</h1>

	<p>
		AND there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech king of the Philistines unto Gerar.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto Abraham thy father;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven, and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said, She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest, said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah; because she was fair to look upon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she is thy wife: and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he became very great:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped them, and filled them with earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much mightier than we.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley of Gerar, and dwelt there.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a well of springing water.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen, saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well Esek; because they strove with him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he called the name of it Sitnah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth; and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we shall be fruitful in the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And he went up from thence to Beer-sheba.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the LORD and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants digged a well.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye hate me, and have sent me away from you?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and said unto him, We have found water.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba unto this day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.
