		<h1>Genesis Chapter 15</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		AFTER these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.
	</p>
