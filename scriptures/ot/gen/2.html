		<h1>Genesis Chapter 2</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THUS the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is Euphrates.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.
	</p>
