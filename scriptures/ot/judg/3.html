		<h1>Judges Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		NOW these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon unto the entering in of Hamath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim eight years.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushan-rishathaim.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto Eglon the king of Moab.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was a very fat man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mount, and he before them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest fourscore years.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered Israel.
