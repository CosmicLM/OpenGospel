	<p>
		THEN Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's belly,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD, and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou heardest my voice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and thy waves passed over me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again toward thy holy temple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O LORD my God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry land.
