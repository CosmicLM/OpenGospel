<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master, where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons? saith the LORD of hosts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.
