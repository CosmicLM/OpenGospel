		<h1>Lamentations Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		REMEMBER, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.
	</p>
</li>
