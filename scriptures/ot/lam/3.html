		<h1>Lamentations Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I AM the man that hath seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		He hath led me, and brought me into darkness, but not into light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Surely against me is he turned; he turneth his hand against me all the day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		My flesh and my skin hath he made old; he hath broken my bones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		He hath builded against me, and compassed me with gall and travail.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He hath set me in dark places, as they that be dead of old.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He hath hedged me about, that I cannot get out: he hath made my chain heavy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Also when I cry and shout, he shutteth out my prayer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		He hath inclosed my ways with hewn stone, he hath made my paths crooked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He was unto me as a bear lying in wait, and as a lion in secret places.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He hath turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces: he hath made me desolate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		He hath bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		He hath caused the arrows of his quiver to enter into my reins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I was a derision to all my people; and their song all the day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		He hath filled me with bitterness, he hath made me drunken with wormwood.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		He hath also broken my teeth with gravel stones, he hath covered me with ashes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And thou hast removed my soul far off from peace: I forgat prosperity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And I said, My strength and my hope is perished from the LORD:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Remembering mine affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		My soul hath them still in remembrance, and is humbled in me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		This I recall to my mind, therefore have I hope.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		It is of the LORD's mercies that we are not consumed, because his compassions fail not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		They are new every morning: great is thy faithfulness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		The LORD is my portion, saith my soul; therefore will I hope in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The LORD is good unto them that wait for him, to the soul that seeketh him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		It is good that a man should both hope and quietly wait for the salvation of the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		He sitteth alone and keepeth silence, because he hath borne it upon him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		He putteth his mouth in the dust; if so be there may be hope.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		He giveth his cheek to him that smiteth him: he is filled full with reproach.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		For the Lord will not cast off for ever:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		But though he cause grief, yet will he have compassion according to the multitude of his mercies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		For he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		To crush under his feet all the prisoners of the earth,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		To turn aside the right of a man before the face of the most High,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord approveth not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		Who is he that saith, and it cometh to pass, when the Lord commandeth it not?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		Out of the mouth of the most High proceedeth not evil and good?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the punishment of his sins?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		Let us lift up our heart with our hands unto God in the heavens.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		We have transgressed and have rebelled: thou hast not pardoned.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		Thou hast covered with anger, and persecuted us: thou hast slain, thou hast not pitied.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		Thou hast covered thyself with a cloud, that our prayer should not pass through.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		Thou hast made us as the offscouring and refuse in the midst of the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		All our enemies have opened their mouths against us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		Fear and a snare is come upon us, desolation and destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		Mine eye runneth down with rivers of water for the destruction of the daughter of my people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		Mine eye trickleth down, and ceaseth not, without any intermission,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		Till the LORD look down, and behold from heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		Mine eye affecteth mine heart because of all the daughters of my city.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		Mine enemies chased me sore, like a bird, without cause.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="53">
	<p>
		They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and cast a stone upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="54">
	<p>
		Waters flowed over mine head; then I said, I am cut off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="55">
	<p>
		I called upon thy name, O LORD, out of the low dungeon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="56">
	<p>
		Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="57">
	<p>
		Thou drewest near in the day that I called upon thee: thou saidst, Fear not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="58">
	<p>
		O Lord, thou hast pleaded the causes of my soul; thou hast redeemed my life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="59">
	<p>
		O LORD, thou hast seen my wrong: judge thou my cause.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="60">
	<p>
		Thou hast seen all their vengeance and all their imaginations against me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="61">
	<p>
		Thou hast heard their reproach, O LORD, and all their imaginations against me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="62">
	<p>
		The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device against me all the day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="63">
	<p>
		Behold their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their musick.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="64">
	<p>
		Render unto them a recompence, O LORD, according to the work of their hands.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="65">
	<p>
		Give them sorrow of heart, thy curse unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="66">
	<p>
		Persecute and destroy them in anger from under the heavens of the LORD.
	</p>
