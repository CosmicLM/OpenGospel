	<p>
		NOW after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an hundred chariots.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Then David put garrisons in Syria-damascus; and the Syrians became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer, brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and silver and brass.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines, and from Amalek.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and justice among all his people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, recorder.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.
