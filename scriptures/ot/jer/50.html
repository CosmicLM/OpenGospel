		<h1>Jeremiah Chapter 50</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE word that the LORD spake against Babylon and against the land of the Chaldeans by Jeremiah the prophet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Remove out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against Babylon an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by Babylon shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Put yourselves in array against Babylon round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Israel is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of Assyria hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon hath broken his bones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished the king of Assyria.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And I will bring Israel again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount Ephraim and Gilead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O Babylon, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Call together the archers against Babylon: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of Israel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of Israel and the children of Judah were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of Babylon, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of Babylon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		The king of Babylon hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of Jordan unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against Babylon; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.
	</p>
