		<h1>Revelation Chapter 2</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		UNTO the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And I will give him the morning star.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.
	</p>
