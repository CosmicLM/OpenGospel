		<h1>Hebrews Chapter 8</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		NOW of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord pitched, and not man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was established upon better promises.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no place have been sought for the second.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least to the greatest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old. Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away.
	</p>
</li>
