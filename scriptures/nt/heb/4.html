		LET us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.
	</p>
