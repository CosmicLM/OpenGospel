		LET brotherly love continue.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.

<li name="8">
	<p>
		Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Grace be with you all. Amen.
