		<h1>Ephesians Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BE ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
	</p>
