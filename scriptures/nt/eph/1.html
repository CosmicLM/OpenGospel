	<p>
		PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.
	</p>
