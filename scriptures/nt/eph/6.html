		<h1>Ephesians Chapter 6</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		CHILDREN, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
