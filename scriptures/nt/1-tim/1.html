		<h1>1 Timothy Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.
	</p>
