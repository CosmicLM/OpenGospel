		<h1>1 Timothy Chapter 2</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I EXHORT therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For Adam was first formed, then Eve.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.
	</p>
