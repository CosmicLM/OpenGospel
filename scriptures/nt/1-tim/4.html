		<h1>1 Timothy Chapter 4</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		NOW the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		These things command and teach.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.
