<li name="1">
	<p>
		THOU therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.
	</p>
