<li name="1">
	<p>
		THIS know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.
	</p>
