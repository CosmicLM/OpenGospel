<li name="1">
	<p>
		BUT of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Rejoice evermore.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Pray without ceasing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Quench not the Spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Despise not prophesyings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Abstain from all appearance of evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Brethren, pray for us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.
