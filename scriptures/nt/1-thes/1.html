		PAUL, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.

	<p>
		We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Remembering without ceasing your work of faith, and labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God and our Father;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as ye know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For from you sounded out the word of the Lord not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your faith to God-ward is spread abroad; so that we need not to speak any thing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come.
