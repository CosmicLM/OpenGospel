		<h1>Matthew Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.
	</p>
