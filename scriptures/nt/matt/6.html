		<h1>Matthew Chapter 6</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		TAKE heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Give us this day our daily bread.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy face;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		(For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.
	</p>
