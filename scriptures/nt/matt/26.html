		<h1>Matthew Chapter 26</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the chief priests,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made ready the passover.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And he answered and said, He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, Thou hast said.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then came they, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="53">
	<p>
		Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="54">
	<p>
		But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="55">
	<p>
		In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="56">
	<p>
		But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="57">
	<p>
		And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="58">
	<p>
		But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="59">
	<p>
		Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against Jesus, to put him to death;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="60">
	<p>
		But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="61">
	<p>
		And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="62">
	<p>
		And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="63">
	<p>
		But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="64">
	<p>
		Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="65">
	<p>
		Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="66">
	<p>
		What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="67">
	<p>
		Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="68">
	<p>
		Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="69">
	<p>
		Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="70">
	<p>
		But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="71">
	<p>
		And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="72">
	<p>
		And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="73">
	<p>
		And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="74">
	<p>
		Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="75">
	<p>
		And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him, Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and wept bitterly.
