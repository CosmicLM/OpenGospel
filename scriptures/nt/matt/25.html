		<h1>Matthew Chapter 25</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.
	</p>
