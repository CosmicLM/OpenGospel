		<h1>2 Peter Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		SIMON Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		According as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue; and to virtue knowledge;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and to patience godliness;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness charity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall never fall:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be established in the present truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in remembrance;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease to have these things always in remembrance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were with him in the holy mount.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.
	</p>
</li>
