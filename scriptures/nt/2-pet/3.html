		<h1>2 Peter Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THIS second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
