		<h1>Mark Chapter 15</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And they cried out again, Crucify him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Save thyself, and come down from the cross.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani? which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		(Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		Joseph of Arimathaea, and honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.
