<li name="1">
	<p>
		BRETHREN, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For every man shall bear his own burden.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
	</p>
