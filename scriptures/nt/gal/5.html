		<h1>Galatians Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		STAND fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.
	</p>
</li>
