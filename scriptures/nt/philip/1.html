		<h1>Philippians Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		PAUL and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		I thank my God upon every remembrance of you,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers of my grace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.
	</p>
</li>
