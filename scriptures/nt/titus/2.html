		BUT speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority. Let no man despise thee.
