		<h1>Titus Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		PAUL, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.
	</p>
</li>
