		AND the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto Pilate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee to this place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself also was at Jerusalem at that time.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And Herod with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		I will therefore chastise him, and release him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		(For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us Barabbas:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spake again to them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		But Jesus turning unto them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be Christ, the chosen of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be Christ, save thyself and us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		And he said unto Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		And Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		This man went unto Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="53">
	<p>
		And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="54">
	<p>
		And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="55">
	<p>
		And the women also, which came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="56">
	<p>
		And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.
	</p>
