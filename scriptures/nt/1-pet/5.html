		<h1>1 Peter Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
	</p>
