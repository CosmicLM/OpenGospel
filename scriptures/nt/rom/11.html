		<h1>Romans Chapter 11</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		I SAY then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompence unto them:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.
	</p>
