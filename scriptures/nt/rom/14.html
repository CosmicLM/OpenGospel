		HIM that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it. He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But why dost thou judge thy brother? or why dost thou set at nought thy brother? for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For meat destroy not the work of God. All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.
	</p>
