	<p>
		I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Be of the same mind one toward another. Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate. Be not wise in your own conceits.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Recompense to no man evil for evil. Provide things honest in the sight of all men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.
	</p>
