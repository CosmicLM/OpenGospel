<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHAT shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For he that is dead is freed from sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
