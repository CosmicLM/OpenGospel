		<h1>Romans Chapter 7</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		KNOW ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
	</p>
