		<h1>Romans Chapter 3</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHAT advantage then hath the Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance? (I speak as a man)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		What then? are we better than they? No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Their feet are swift to shed blood:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Destruction and misery are in their ways:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And the way of peace have they not known:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		There is no fear of God before their eyes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Do we then make void the law through faith? God forbid: yea, we establish the law.
	</p>
