		<h1>John Chapter 12</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		THEN Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, which should betray him,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus also to death;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Fear not, daughter of Sion: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Philip cometh and telleth Andrew: and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		This he said, signifying what death he should die.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Then Jesus said unto them, Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. These things spake Jesus, and departed, and did hide himself from them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak.
	</p>
