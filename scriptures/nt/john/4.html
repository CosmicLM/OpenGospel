		<h1>John Chapter 4</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		WHEN therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		(Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And he must needs go through Samaria.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		(For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the Christ?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		And many more believed because of his own word;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went his way.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="53">
	<p>
		So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="54">
	<p>
		This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was come out of Judaea into Galilee.
	</p>
