		<h1>John Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AFTER this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which had made him whole.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Ye sent unto John, and he bare witness unto the truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		I receive not honour from men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even Moses, in whom ye trust.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		For had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words?
	</p>
