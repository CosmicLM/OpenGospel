		<h1>John Chapter 16</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THESE things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		They shall put you out of the synagogues: yea, the time cometh, that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father, nor me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		But these things have I told you, that when the time shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. And these things I said not unto you at the beginning, because I was with you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But now I go my way to him that sent me; and none of you asketh me, Whither goest thou?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But because I have said these things unto you, sorrow hath filled your heart.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Of sin, because they believe not on me;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Of righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will shew you things to come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		All things that the Father hath are mine: therefore said I, that he shall take of mine, and shall shew it unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, because I go to the Father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Then said some of his disciples among themselves, What is this that he saith unto us, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me: and, Because I go to the Father?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		They said therefore, What is this that he saith, A little while? we cannot tell what he saith.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask him, and said unto them, Do ye enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Verily, verily, I say unto you, That ye shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and ye shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		A woman when she is in travail hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembereth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And ye now therefore have sorrow: but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice, and your joy no man taketh from you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And in that day ye shall ask me nothing. Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Hitherto have ye asked nothing in my name: ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		For the Father himself loveth you, because ye have loved me, and have believed that I came out from God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world: again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Now are we sure that thou knowest all things, and needest not that any man should ask thee: by this we believe that thou camest forth from God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Jesus answered them, Do ye now believe?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.
	</p>
