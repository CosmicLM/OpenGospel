	<p>
		AND the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three firkins apiece.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not many days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And said unto them that sold doves, Take these things hence; make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thine house hath eaten me up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Then answered the Jews and said unto him, What sign shewest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		But he spake of the temple of his body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		When therefore he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		But Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.
