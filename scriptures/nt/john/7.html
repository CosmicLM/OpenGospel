		<h1>John Chapter 7</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		AFTER these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		For neither did his brethren believe in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast; for my time is not yet full come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in Galilee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and ye all marvel.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Then said some of them of Jerusalem, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when Christ cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught, saying, Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		(But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		Others said, This is the Christ. But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		Hath not the scripture said, That Christ cometh of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="43">
	<p>
		So there was a division among the people because of him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="44">
	<p>
		And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="45">
	<p>
		Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="46">
	<p>
		The officers answered, Never man spake like this man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="47">
	<p>
		Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="48">
	<p>
		Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="49">
	<p>
		But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="50">
	<p>
		Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to Jesus by night, being one of them,)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="51">
	<p>
		Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="52">
	<p>
		They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of Galilee? Search, and look: for out of Galilee ariseth no prophet.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="53">
	<p>
		And every man went unto his own house.
	</p>
