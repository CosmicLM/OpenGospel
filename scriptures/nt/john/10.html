		<h1>John Chapter 10</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him: for they know his voice.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the sheep did not hear them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay down my life for the sheep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I might take it again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This commandment have I received of my Father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these sayings.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear ye him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it was winter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		I and my Father are one.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man, makest thyself God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of God?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="37">
	<p>
		If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="38">
	<p>
		But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="39">
	<p>
		Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of their hand,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="40">
	<p>
		And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at first baptized; and there he abode.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="41">
	<p>
		And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but all things that John spake of this man were true.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="42">
	<p>
		And many believed on him there.
	</p>
