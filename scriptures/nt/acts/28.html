		AND when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.
	</p>
