		<h1>1 John Chapter 4</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BELOVED, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and the world heareth them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he in God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us. God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		We love him, because he first loved us.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen, how can he love God whom he hath not seen?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God love his brother also.
	</p>
</li>
