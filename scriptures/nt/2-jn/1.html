<li name="1">
	<p>
		THE elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
	</p>
