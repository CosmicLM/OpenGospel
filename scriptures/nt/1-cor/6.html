		<h1>1 Corinthians Chapter 6</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		DARE any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.
	</p>
</li>
