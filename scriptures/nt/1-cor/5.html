		<h1>1 Corinthians Chapter 5</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		IT is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.
	</p>
</li>
