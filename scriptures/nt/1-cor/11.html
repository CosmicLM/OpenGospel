		<h1>1 Corinthians Chapter 11</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BE ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come.
	</p>
