		<h1>1 Corinthians Chapter 12</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		NOW concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		For the body is not one member, but many.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And if they were all one member, where were the body?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		But now are they many members, yet but one body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.
	</p>
