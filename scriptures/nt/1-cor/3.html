		<h1>1 Corinthians Chapter 3</h1>

<li name="1">
	<p>
		AND I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.
	</p>
</li>
