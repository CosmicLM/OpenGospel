		<h1>1 Corinthians Chapter 13</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		THOUGH I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
	</p>
