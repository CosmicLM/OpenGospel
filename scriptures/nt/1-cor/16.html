<li name="1">
	<p>
		NOW concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Let all your things be done with charity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maran-atha.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
