		<h1>Philemon Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		PAUL, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
	</p>
</li>
