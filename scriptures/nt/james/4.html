		<h1>James Chapter 4</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		FROM whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.
	</p>
</li>
