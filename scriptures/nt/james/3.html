<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.
	</p>
</li>
