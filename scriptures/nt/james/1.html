		<h1>James Chapter 1</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		JAMES, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Do not err, my beloved brethren.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.
	</p>
