		<h1>James Chapter 2</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		MY brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
	</p>
