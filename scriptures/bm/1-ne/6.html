<li name="1">
	<p>
		And now I, Nephi, do not give the genealogy of my fathers in this part of my record; neither at any time shall I give it after upon these plates which I am writing; for it is given in the record which has been kept by my father; wherefore, I do not write it in this work.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be written upon these plates, for I desire the room that I may write of the things of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		For the fulness of mine intent is that I may persuade men to come unto the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, and be saved.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Wherefore, the things which are pleasing unto the world I do not write, but the things which are pleasing unto God and unto those who are not of the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Wherefore, I shall give commandment unto my seed, that they shall not occupy these plates with things which are not of worth unto the children of men.
