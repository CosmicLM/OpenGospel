		<h1>1 Nephi Chapter 11</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look! And I looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious above all.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And he said unto me: What desirest thou?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof--for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look! And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from before my presence.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And the angel said unto me again: Look and behold the condescension of God!
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="28">
	<p>
		And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="29">
	<p>
		And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came to pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before my face, and I saw them not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="30">
	<p>
		And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="31">
	<p>
		And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="32">
	<p>
		And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="33">
	<p>
		And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="34">
	<p>
		And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="35">
	<p>
		And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the building which my father saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="36">
	<p>
		And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
