<li name="2">
	<p>
		After they had prayed unto the Father in the name of Christ, they laid their hands upon them, and said:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		In the name of Jesus Christ I ordain you to be a priest, (or, if he be a teacher) I ordain you to be a teacher, to preach repentance and remission of sins through Jesus Christ, by the endurance of faith on his name to the end. Amen.
	</p>
</li>

	<p>
		And after this manner did they ordain priests and teachers, according to the gifts and callings of God unto men; and they ordained them by the power of the Holy Ghost, which was in them.
