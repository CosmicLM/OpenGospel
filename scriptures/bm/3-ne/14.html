		<h1>3 Nephi Chapter 14</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of thine eye--and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask bread, will give him a stone?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, which leadeth to destruction, and many there be who go in thereat;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="14">
	<p>
		Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="18">
	<p>
		A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="19">
	<p>
		Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="20">
	<p>
		Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="21">
	<p>
		Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="22">
	<p>
		Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?
	</p>
</li>
<li name="23">
	<p>
		And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="24">
	<p>
		Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock--
	</p>
</li>
<li name="25">
	<p>
		And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="26">
	<p>
		And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand--
	</p>
</li>
<li name="27">
	<p>
		And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.
	</p>
