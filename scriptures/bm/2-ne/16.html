		<h1>2 Nephi Chapter 16</h1>
		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		In the year that king Uzziah died, I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Above it stood the seraphim; each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And one cried unto another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		Then said I: Wo is unto me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips; and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And he laid it upon my mouth, and said: Lo, this has touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin purged.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said: Here am I; send me.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And he said: Go and tell this people--Hear ye indeed, but they understood not; and see ye indeed, but they perceived not.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes--lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and be healed.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		Then said I: Lord, how long? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And the Lord have removed men far away, for there shall be a great forsaking in the midst of the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="13">
	<p>
		But yet there shall be a tenth, and they shall return, and shall be eaten, as a teil-tree, and as an oak whose substance is in them when they cast their leaves; so the holy seed shall be the substance thereof.
	</p>
