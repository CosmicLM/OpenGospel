		And in that day thou shalt say: O Lord, I will praise thee; though thou wast angry with me thine anger is turned away, and thou comfortedest me.

		Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid; for the Lord JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also has become my salvation.

		Therefore, with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation.

		And in that day shall ye say: Praise the Lord, call upon his name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that his name is exalted.

	<p>
		Sing unto the Lord; for he hath done excellent things; this is known in all the earth.
