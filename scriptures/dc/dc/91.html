<li name="1">
	<p>
		VERILY, thus saith the Lord unto you concerning the Apocrypha--There are many things contained therein that are true, and it is mostly translated correctly;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		There are many things contained therein that are not true, which are interpolations by the hands of men.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Verily, I say unto you, that it is not needful that the Apocrypha should be translated.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Therefore, whoso readeth it, let him understand, for the Spirit manifesteth truth;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And whoso is enlightened by the Spirit shall obtain benefit therefrom;
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And whoso receiveth not by the Spirit, cannot be benefited. Therefore it is not needful that it should be translated. Amen.
