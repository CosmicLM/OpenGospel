<li name="1">
	<p>
		BEHOLD, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he who was crucified for the sins of the world--
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, my servant Newel Knight, you shall stand fast in the office whereunto I have appointed you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And if your brethren desire to escape their enemies, let them repent of all their sins, and become truly humble before me and contrite.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		And as the covenant which they made unto me has been broken, even so it has become void and of none effect.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And wo to him by whom this offense cometh, for it had been better for him that he had been drowned in the depth of the sea.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		But blessed are they who have kept the covenant and observed the commandment, for they shall obtain mercy.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you; and take your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay moneys for you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		And after you have done journeying, behold, I say unto you, seek ye a living like unto men, until I prepare a place for you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And again, be patient in tribulation until I come; and, behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, and they who have sought me early shall find rest to their souls. Even so. Amen.
