<li name="1">
	<p>
		THERE are two kinds of beings in heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected personages, having bodies of flesh and bones--
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		For instance, Jesus said: Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect, they who are not resurrected, but inherit the same glory.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for that is the only way he can appear--
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still deliver his message.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		If it be the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore detect him.
	</p>

	<p>
		These are three grand keys whereby you may know whether any administration is from God.
