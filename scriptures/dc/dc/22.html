		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		BEHOLD, I say unto you that all old covenants have I caused to be done away in this thing; and this is a new and an everlasting covenant, even that which was from the beginning.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Wherefore, although a man should be baptized an hundred times it availeth him nothing, for you cannot enter in at the strait gate by the law of Moses, neither by your dead works.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		For it is because of your dead works that I have caused this last covenant and this church to be built up unto me, even as in days of old.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Wherefore, enter ye in at the gate, as I have commanded, and seek not to counsel your God. Amen.
