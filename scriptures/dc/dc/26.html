		BEHOLD, I say unto you that you shall let your time be devoted to the studying of the scriptures, and to preaching, and to confirming the church at Colesville, and to performing your labors on the land, such as is required, until after you shall go to the west to hold the next conference; and then it shall be made known what you shall do.

		And all things shall be done by common consent in the church, by much prayer and faith, for all things you shall receive by faith. Amen.
