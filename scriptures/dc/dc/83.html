		<ol>
<li name="1">
	<p>
		VERILY, thus saith the Lord, in addition to the laws of the church concerning women and children, those who belong to the church, who have lost their husbands or fathers:
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have fellowship in the church.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And if they are not faithful they shall not have fellowship in the church; yet they may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		All children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And after that, they have claim upon the church, or in other words upon the Lord's storehouse, if their parents have not wherewith to give them inheritances.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and widows and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor. Amen.
	</p>
