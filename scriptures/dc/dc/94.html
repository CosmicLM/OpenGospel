	<p>
		AND again, verily I say unto you, my friends, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall commence a work of laying out and preparing a beginning and foundation of the city of the stake of Zion, here in the land of Kirtland, beginning at my house.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="2">
	<p>
		And behold, it must be done according to the pattern which I have given unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="3">
	<p>
		And let the first lot on the south be consecrated unto me for the building of a house for the presidency, for the work of the presidency, in obtaining revelations; and for the work of the ministry of the presidency, in all things pertaining to the church and kingdom.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="4">
	<p>
		Verily I say unto you, that it shall be built fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and in the length thereof, in the inner court.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="5">
	<p>
		And there shall be a lower court and a higher court, according to the pattern which shall be given unto you hereafter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="6">
	<p>
		And it shall be dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation thereof, according to the order of the priesthood, according to the pattern which shall be given unto you hereafter.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="7">
	<p>
		And it shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord for the work of the presidency.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="8">
	<p>
		And ye shall not suffer any unclean thing to come in unto it; and my glory shall be there, and my presence shall be there.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="9">
	<p>
		But if there shall come into it any unclean thing, my glory shall not be there; and my presence shall not come into it.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="10">
	<p>
		And again, verily I say unto you, the second lot on the south shall be dedicated unto me for the building of a house unto me, for the work of the printing of the translation of my scriptures, and all things whatsoever I shall command you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="11">
	<p>
		And it shall be fifty-five by sixty-five feet in the width thereof and the length thereof, in the inner court; and there shall be a lower and a higher court.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="12">
	<p>
		And this house shall be wholly dedicated unto the Lord from the foundation thereof, for the work of the printing, in all things whatsoever I shall command you, to be holy, undefiled, according to the pattern in all things as it shall be given unto you.

<li name="13">
	<p>
		And on the third lot shall my servant Hyrum Smith receive his inheritance.

<li name="14">
	<p>
		And on the first and second lots on the north shall my servants Reynolds Cahoon and Jared Carter receive their inheritances--
	</p>
</li>
<li name="15">
	<p>
		That they may do the work which I have appointed unto them, to be a committee to build mine houses, according to the commandment, which I, the Lord God, have given unto you.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="16">
	<p>
		These two houses are not to be built until I give unto you a commandment concerning them.
	</p>
</li>
<li name="17">
	<p>
		And now I give unto you no more at this time. Amen.
