				<b>2.</b> The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light; they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them hath the light shined.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="3">
			<p>
				<b>3.</b> Thou hast multiplied the nation, and increased the joy-they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="4">
			<p>
				<b>4.</b> For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="5">
			<p>
				<b>5.</b> For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="6">
			<p>
				<b>6.</b> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counselor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="7">
			<p>
				<b>7.</b> Of the increase of government and peace there is no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth, even forever. The zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this.

		<a name="8">
			<p>
				<b>8.</b> The Lord sent his word unto Jacob and it hath lighted upon Israel.

		<a name="9">
			<p>
				<b>9.</b> And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart:

			<p>
				<b>10.</b> The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn stones; the sycamores are cut down, but we will change them into cedars.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="11">
			<p>
				<b>11.</b> Therefore the Lord shall set up the adversaries of Rezin against him, and join his enemies together;
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="12">
			<p>
				<b>12.</b> The Syrians before and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

		<a name="13">
			<p>
				<b>13.</b> For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither do they seek the Lord of Hosts.

				<b>14.</b> Therefore will the Lord cut off from Israel head and tail, branch and rush in one day.

				<b>15.</b> The ancient, he is the head; and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail.

				<b>16.</b> For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they that are led of them are destroyed.

				<b>17.</b> Therefore the Lord shall have no joy in their young men, neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows; for every one of them is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

		<a name="19">
			<p>
				<b>19.</b> Through the wrath of the Lord of Hosts is the land darkened, and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire; no man shall spare his brother.
