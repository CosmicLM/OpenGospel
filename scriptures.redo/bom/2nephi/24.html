			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="2">
			<p>
				<b>2.</b> And the people shall take them and bring them to their place; yea, from far unto the ends of the earth; and they shall return to their lands of promise. And the house of Israel shall possess them, and the land of the Lord shall be for servants and handmaids; and they shall take them captives unto whom they were captives; and they shall rule over their oppressors.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="3">
			<p>
				<b>3.</b> And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall give thee rest, from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="4">
			<p>
				<b>4.</b> And it shall come to pass in that day, that thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of Babylon, and say: How hath the oppressor ceased, the golden city ceased!
			</p>

		<a name="5">
			<p>
				<b>5.</b> The Lord hath broken the staff of the wicked, the scepters of the rulers.

		</a>
		<a name="9">
			<p>
				<b>9.</b> Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy coming; it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="10">
			<p>
				<b>10.</b> All they shall speak and say unto thee: Art thou also become weak as we? Art thou become like unto us?
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="11">
			<p>
				<b>11.</b> Thy pomp is brought down to the grave; the noise of thy viols is not heard; the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover thee.

		</a>
		<a name="17">
			<p>
				<b>17.</b> And made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities thereof, and opened not the house of his prisoners?

				<b>18.</b> All the kings of the nations, yea, all of them, lie in glory, every one of them in his own house.

		</a>
		<a name="19">
			<p>
				<b>19.</b> But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch, and the remnant of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under feet.

		</a>
		<a name="20">
			<p>
				<b>20.</b> Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou hast destroyed thy land and slain thy people; the seed of evil-doers shall never be renowned

		<a name="23">
			<p>
				<b>23.</b> I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of water; and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction, saith the Lord of Hosts.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="24">
			<p>
				<b>24.</b> The Lord of Hosts hath sworn, saying: Surely as I have thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so shall it stand-
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="25">
			<p>
				<b>25.</b> That I will bring the Assyrian in my land, and upon my mountains tread him under foot; then shall his yoke depart from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.

		</a>
		<a name="26">
			<p>
				<b>26.</b> This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretched out upon all nations.
