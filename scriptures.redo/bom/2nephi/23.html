			<p>
				<b>2.</b> Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="3">
			<p>
				<b>3.</b> I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones, for mine anger is not upon them that rejoice in my highness.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="4">
			<p>
				<b>4.</b> The noise of the multitude in the mountains like as of a great people, a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together, the Lord of Hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="5">
			<p>
				<b>5.</b> They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, yea, the Lord, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.

			<p>
				<b>8.</b> And they shall be afraid; pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.

		</a>
		<a name="9">
			<p>
				<b>9.</b> Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="10">
			<p>
				<b>10.</b> For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="11">
			<p>
				<b>11.</b> And I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay down the haughtiness of the terrible.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="12">
			<p>
				<b>12.</b> I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="13">
			<p>
				<b>13.</b> Therefore, I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of Hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.

		<a name="14">
			<p>
				<b>14.</b> And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up; and they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.

			<p>
				<b>15.</b> Every one that is proud shall be thrust through; yea, and every one that is joined to the wicked shall fall by the sword.

				<b>16.</b> Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished.
			</p>

		<a name="17">
			<p>
				<b>17.</b> Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver and gold, nor shall they delight in it.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="18">
			<p>
				<b>18.</b> Their bows shall also dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="19">
			<p>
				<b>19.</b> And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees’ excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="20">
			<p>
				<b>20.</b> It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="21">
			<p>
				<b>21.</b> But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="22">
			<p>
				<b>22.</b> And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces; and her time is near to come, and her day shall not be prolonged. For I will destroy her speedily; yea, for I will be merciful unto my people, but the wicked shall perish.
