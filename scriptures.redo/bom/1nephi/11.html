				<b class="first">F</b>or it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="2">
			<p>
				<b>2.</b> And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="3">
			<p>
				<b>3.</b> And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="4">
			<p>
				<b>4.</b> And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken?
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="5">
			<p>
				<b>5.</b> And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="6">
			<p>
				<b>6.</b> And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all. And blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="7">
			<p>
				<b>7.</b> And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="8">
			<p>
				<b>8.</b> And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look! And I looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="9">
			<p>
				<b>9.</b> And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious above all.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="10">
			<p>
				<b>10.</b> And he said unto me: What desirest thou?
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="11">
			<p>
				<b>11.</b> And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereofâ€”for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="12">
			<p>
				<b>12.</b> And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look! And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from before my presence.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="13">
			<p>
				<b>13.</b> And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="14">
			<p>
				<b>14.</b> And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="15">
			<p>
				<b>15.</b> And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="16">
			<p>
				<b>16.</b> And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="17">
			<p>
				<b>17.</b> And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="18">
			<p>
				<b>18.</b> And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="19">
			<p>
				<b>19.</b> And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="20">
			<p>
				<b>20.</b> And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="21">
			<p>
				<b>21.</b> And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father! Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="22">
			<p>
				<b>22.</b> And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="23">
			<p>
				<b>23.</b> And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="24">
			<p>
				<b>24.</b> And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="25">
			<p>
				<b>25.</b> And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="26">
			<p>
				<b>26.</b> And the angel said unto me again: Look and behold the condescension of God!
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="27">
			<p>
				<b>27.</b> And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="28">
			<p>
				<b>28.</b> And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="29">
			<p>
				<b>29.</b> And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came to pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before my face, and I saw them not.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="30">
			<p>
				<b>30.</b> And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="31">
			<p>
				<b>31.</b> And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="32">
			<p>
				<b>32.</b> And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="33">
			<p>
				<b>33.</b> And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="34">
			<p>
				<b>34.</b> And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="35">
			<p>
				<b>35.</b> And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the building which my father saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
			</p>
		</a>
		<a name="36">
			<p>
				<b>36.</b> And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
