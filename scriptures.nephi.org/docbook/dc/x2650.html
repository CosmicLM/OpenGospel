><P
>1. VERILY, thus saith the Lord unto you, my friends Sidney and Joseph, your families are well; they are in mine hands, and I will do with them as seemeth me good; for in me there is all power.</P
><P
>2. Therefore, follow me, and listen to the counsel which I shall give unto you.</P
><P
>3. Behold, and lo, I have much people in this place, in the regions round about; and an effectual door shall be opened in the regions round about in this eastern land.</P
><P
>4. Therefore, I, the Lord, have suffered you to come unto this place; for thus it was expedient in me for the salvation of souls.</P
><P
>5. Therefore, verily I say unto you, lift up your voices unto this people; speak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be confounded before men;</P
><P
>6. For it shall be given you in the very hour, yea, in the very moment, what ye shall say.</P
><P
>7. But a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall declare whatsoever thing ye declare in my name, in solemnity of heart, in the spirit of meekness, in all things.</P
><P
>8. And I give unto you this promise, that inasmuch as ye do this the Holy Ghost shall be shed forth in bearing record unto all things whatsoever ye shall say.</P
><P
>9. And it is expedient in me that you, my servant Sidney, should be a spokesman unto this people; yea, verily, I will ordain you unto this calling, even to be a spokesman unto my servant Joseph.</P
><P
>10. And I will give unto him power to be mighty in testimony.</P
><P
>11. And I will give unto thee power to be mighty in expounding all scriptures, that thou mayest be a spokesman unto him, and he shall be a revelator unto thee, that thou mayest know the certainty of all things pertaining to the things of my kingdom on the earth.</P
><P
>12. Therefore, continue your journey and let your hearts rejoice; for behold, and lo, I am with you even unto the end.</P
><P
>13. And now I give unto you a word concerning Zion.  Zion shall be redeemed, although she is chastened for a little season.</P
><P
>14. Thy brethren, my servants Orson Hyde and John Gould, are in my hands; and inasmuch as they keep my commandments they shall be saved.</P
><P
>15. Therefore, let your hearts be comforted; for all things shall work together for good to them that walk uprightly, and to the sanctification of the church.</P
><P
>16. For I will raise up unto myself a pure people, that will serve me in righteousness;</P
><P
>17. And all that call upon the name of the Lord, and keep his commandments, shall be saved.  Even so.  Amen.</P
