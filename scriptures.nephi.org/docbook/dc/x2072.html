>1. VERILY, thus saith the Lord, in addition to the laws of the church concerning women and children, those who belong to the church, who have lost their husbands or fathers:</P
><P
>2. Women have claim on their husbands for their maintenance, until their husbands are taken; and if they are not found transgressors they shall have fellowship in the church.</P
><P
>3. And if they are not faithful they shall not have fellowship in the church; yet they may remain upon their inheritances according to the laws of the land.</P
><P
>4. All children have claim upon their parents for their maintenance until they are of age.</P
><P
>5. And after that, they have claim upon the church, or in other words upon the Lord's storehouse, if their parents have not wherewith to give them inheritances.</P
><P
>6. And the storehouse shall be kept by the consecrations of the church; and widows and orphans shall be provided for, as also the poor.  Amen.</P
