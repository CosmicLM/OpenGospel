>1.33. Chapter 33</H1
><P
>1. BEHOLD, I say unto you, my servants Ezra and Northrop, open ye your ears and hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, whose word is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged sword, to the dividing asunder of the joints and marrow, soul and spirit; and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</P
><P
>2. For verily, verily, I say unto you that ye are called to lift up your voices as with the sound of a trump, to declare my gospel unto a crooked and perverse generation.</P
><P
>3. For behold, the field is white already to harvest; and it is the eleventh hour, and the last time that I shall call laborers into my vineyard.</P
><P
>4. And my vineyard has become corrupted every whit; and there is none which doeth good save it be a few; and they err in many instances because of priestcrafts, all having corrupt minds.</P
><P
>5. And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this church have I established and called forth out of the wilderness.</P
><P
>6. And even so will I gather mine elect from the four quarters of the earth, even as many as will believe in me, and hearken unto my voice.</P
><P
>7. Yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that the field is white already to harvest; wherefore, thrust in your sickles, and reap with all your might, mind, and strength.</P
><P
>8. Open your mouths and they shall be filled, and you shall become even as Nephi of old, who journeyed from Jerusalem in the wilderness.</P
><P
>9. Yea, open your mouths and spare not, and you shall be laden with sheaves upon your backs, for lo, I am with you.</P
><P
>10. Yea, open your mouths and they shall be filled, saying: Repent, repent, and prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;</P
><P
>11. Yea, repent and be baptized, every one of you, for a remission of your sins; yea, be baptized even by water, and then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost.</P
><P
>12. Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, this is my gospel; and remember that they shall have faith in me or they can in nowise be saved;</P
><P
>13. And upon this rock I will build my church; yea, upon this rock ye are built, and if ye continue, the gates of hell shall not prevail against you.</P
><P
>14. And ye shall remember the church articles and covenants to keep them.</P
><P
>15. And whoso having faith you shall confirm in my church, by the laying on of the hands, and I will bestow the gift of the Holy Ghost upon them.</P
><P
>16. And the Book of Mormon and the holy scriptures are given of me for your instruction; and the power of my Spirit quickeneth all things.</P
><P
>17. Wherefore, be faithful, praying always, having your lamps trimmed and burning, and oil with you, that you may be ready at the coming of the Bridegroom--</P
><P
>18. For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that I come quickly.  Even so.  Amen.</P
