>1.129. Chapter 129</H1
><P
>1. THERE are two kinds of beings in heaven, namely: Angels, who are resurrected personages, having bodies of flesh and bones--</P
><P
>2. For instance, Jesus said: Handle me and see, for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</P
><P
>3. Secondly: the spirits of just men made perfect, they who are not resurrected, but inherit the same glory.</P
><P
>4. When a messenger comes saying he has a message from God, offer him your hand and request him to shake hands with you.</P
><P
>5. If he be an angel he will do so, and you will feel his hand.</P
><P
>6. If he be the spirit of a just man made perfect he will come in his glory; for that is the only way he can appear--</P
><P
>7. Ask him to shake hands with you, but he will not move, because it is contrary to the order of heaven for a just man to deceive; but he will still deliver his message.</P
><P
>8. If it be the devil as an angel of light, when you ask him to shake hands he will offer you his hand, and you will not feel anything; you may therefore detect him.</P
><P
>9. These are three grand keys whereby you may know whether any administration is from God.</P
