><P
>1. BEHOLD, thus saith the Lord, even Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, even he who was crucified for the sins of the world--</P
><P
>2. Behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, my servant Newel Knight, you shall stand fast in the office whereunto I have appointed you.</P
><P
>3. And if your brethren desire to escape their enemies, let them repent of all their sins, and become truly humble before me and contrite.</P
><P
>4. And as the covenant which they made unto me has been broken, even so it has become void and of none effect.</P
><P
>5. And wo to him by whom this offense cometh, for it had been better for him that he had been drowned in the depth of the sea.</P
><P
>6. But blessed are they who have kept the covenant and observed the commandment, for they shall obtain mercy.</P
><P
>7. Wherefore, go to now and flee the land, lest your enemies come upon you; and take your journey, and appoint whom you will to be your leader, and to pay moneys for you.</P
><P
>8. And thus you shall take your journey into the regions westward, unto the land of Missouri, unto the borders of the Lamanites.</P
><P
>9. And after you have done journeying, behold, I say unto you, seek ye a living like unto men, until I prepare a place for you.</P
><P
>10. And again, be patient in tribulation until I come; and, behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, and they who have sought me early shall find rest to their souls.  Even so.  Amen.</P
