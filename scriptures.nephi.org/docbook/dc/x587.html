>1.25. Chapter 25</H1
><P
>1. HEARKEN unto the voice of the Lord your God, while I speak unto you, Emma Smith, my daughter; for verily I say unto you, all those who receive my gospel are sons and daughters in my kingdom.</P
><P
>2. A revelation I give unto you concerning my will; and if thou art faithful and walk in the paths of virtue before me, I will preserve thy life, and thou shalt receive an inheritance in Zion.</P
><P
>3. Behold, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou art an elect lady, whom I have called.</P
><P
>4. Murmur not because of the things which thou hast not seen, for they are withheld from thee and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to come.</P
><P
>5. And the office of thy calling shall be for a comfort unto my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., thy husband, in his afflictions, with consoling words, in the spirit of meekness.</P
><P
>6. And thou shalt go with him at the time of his going, and be unto him for a scribe, while there is no one to be a scribe for him, that I may send my servant, Oliver Cowdery, whithersoever I will.</P
><P
>7. And thou shalt be ordained under his hand to expound scriptures, and to exhort the church, according as it shall be given thee by my Spirit.</P
><P
>8. For he shall lay his hands upon thee, and thou shalt receive the Holy Ghost, and thy time shall be given to writing, and to learning much.</P
><P
>9. And thou needest not fear, for thy husband shall support thee in the church; for unto them is his calling, that all things might be revealed unto them, whatsoever I will, according to their faith.</P
><P
>10. And verily I say unto thee that thou shalt lay aside the things of this world, and seek for the things of a better.</P
><P
>11. And it shall be given thee, also, to make a selection of sacred hymns, as it shall be given thee, which is pleasing unto me, to be had in my church.</P
><P
>12. For my soul delighteth in the song of the heart; yea, the song of the righteous is a prayer unto me, and it shall be answered with a blessing upon their heads.</P
><P
>13. Wherefore, lift up thy heart and rejoice, and cleave unto the covenants which thou hast made.</P
><P
>14. Continue in the spirit of meekness, and beware of pride.  Let thy soul delight in thy husband, and the glory which shall come upon him.</P
><P
>15. Keep my commandments continually, and a crown of righteousness thou shalt receive.  And except thou do this, where I am you cannot come.</P
><P
>16. And verily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my voice unto all.  Amen.</P
