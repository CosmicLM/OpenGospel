>1. MY son Orson, hearken and hear and behold what I, the Lord God, shall say unto you, even Jesus Christ your Redeemer;</P
><P
>2. The light and the life of the world, a light which shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not;</P
><P
>3. Who so loved the world that he gave his own life, that as many as would believe might become the sons of God.  Wherefore you are my son;</P
><P
>4. And blessed are you because you have believed;</P
><P
>5. And more blessed are you because you are called of me to preach my gospel--</P
><P
>6. To lift up your voice as with the sound of a trump, both long and loud, and cry repentance unto a crooked and perverse generation, preparing the way of the Lord for his second coming.</P
><P
>7. For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, the time is soon at hand that I shall come in a cloud with power and great glory.</P
><P
>8. And it shall be a great day at the time of my coming, for all nations shall tremble.</P
><P
>9. But before that great day shall come, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon be turned into blood; and the stars shall refuse their shining, and some shall fall, and great destructions await the wicked.</P
><P
>10. Wherefore, lift up your voice and spare not, for the Lord God hath spoken; therefore prophesy, and it shall be given by the power of the Holy Ghost.</P
><P
>11. And if you are faithful, behold, I am with you until I come--</P
><P
>12. And verily, verily, I say unto you, I come quickly.  I am your Lord and your Redeemer.  Even so.  Amen.</P
