>6.13. Chapter 13</H1
><P
>1. LET every soul be subject unto the higher powers.  For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.</P
><P
>2. Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</P
><P
>3. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.  Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power?  do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:</P
><P
>4. For he is the minister of God to thee for good.  But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain: for he is the minister of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil.</P
><P
>5. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</P
><P
>6. For for this cause pay ye tribute also: for they are God's ministers, attending continually upon this very thing.</P
><P
>7. Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.</P
><P
>8. Owe no man any thing, but to love one another: for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law.</P
><P
>9. For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</P
><P
>10. Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</P
><P
>11. And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed.</P
><P
>12. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.</P
><P
>13. Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.</P
><P
>14. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.</P
