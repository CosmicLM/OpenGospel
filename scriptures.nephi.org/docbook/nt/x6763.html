>12.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. IF ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God.</P
><P
>2. Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.</P
><P
>3. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.</P
><P
>4. When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory.</P
><P
>5. Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:</P
><P
>6. For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:</P
><P
>7. In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them.</P
><P
>8. But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth.</P
><P
>9. Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;</P
><P
>10. And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:</P
><P
>11. Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.</P
><P
>12. Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;</P
><P
>13. Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</P
><P
>14. And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness.</P
><P
>15. And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful.</P
><P
>16. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</P
><P
>17. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him.</P
><P
>18. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</P
><P
>19. Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</P
><P
>20. Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord.</P
><P
>21. Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged.</P
><P
>22. Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God:</P
><P
>23. And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;</P
><P
>24. Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.</P
><P
>25. But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.</P
