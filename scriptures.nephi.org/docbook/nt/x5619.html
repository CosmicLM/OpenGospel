>7.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. DARE any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</P
><P
>2. Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world?  and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</P
><P
>3. Know ye not that we shall judge angels?  how much more things that pertain to this life?</P
><P
>4. If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</P
><P
>5. I speak to your shame.  Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you?  no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</P
><P
>6. But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.</P
><P
>7. Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another.  Why do ye not rather take wrong?  why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?</P
><P
>8. Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</P
><P
>9. Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?  Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</P
><P
>10. Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</P
><P
>11. And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</P
><P
>12. All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.</P
><P
>13. Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them.  Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.</P
><P
>14. And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</P
><P
>15. Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?  shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot?  God forbid.</P
><P
>16. What?  know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body?  for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</P
><P
>17. But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.</P
><P
>18. Flee fornication.  Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.</P
><P
>19. What?  know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?</P
><P
>20. For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.</P
