>9.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. BRETHREN, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</P
><P
>2. Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</P
><P
>3. For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</P
><P
>4. But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.</P
><P
>5. For every man shall bear his own burden.</P
><P
>6. Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</P
><P
>7. Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</P
><P
>8. For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.</P
><P
>9. And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</P
><P
>10. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.</P
><P
>11. Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.</P
><P
>12. As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.</P
><P
>13. For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</P
><P
>14. But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</P
><P
>15. For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</P
><P
>16. And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</P
><P
>17. From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</P
><P
>18. Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Amen.</P
