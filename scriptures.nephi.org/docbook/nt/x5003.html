>5.28. Chapter 28</H1
><P
>1. AND when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was called Melita.</P
><P
>2. And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</P
><P
>3. And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</P
><P
>4. And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</P
><P
>5. And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</P
><P
>6. Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.</P
><P
>7. In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.</P
><P
>8. And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.</P
><P
>9. So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the island, came, and were healed:</P
><P
>10. Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary.</P
><P
>11. And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</P
><P
>12. And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</P
><P
>13. And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:</P
><P
>14. Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</P
><P
>15. And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</P
><P
>16. And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.</P
><P
>17. And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</P
><P
>18. Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.</P
><P
>19. But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</P
><P
>20. For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</P
><P
>21. And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed or spake any harm of thee.</P
><P
>22. But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</P
><P
>23. And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</P
><P
>24. And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.</P
><P
>25. And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet unto our fathers,</P
><P
>26. Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive:</P
><P
>27. For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.</P
><P
>28. Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</P
><P
>29. And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.</P
><P
>30. And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,</P
><P
>31. Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</P
