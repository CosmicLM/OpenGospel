>6.11. Chapter 11</H1
><P
>1. I SAY then, Hath God cast away his people?  God forbid.  For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</P
><P
>2. God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew.  Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias?  how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</P
><P
>3. Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</P
><P
>4. But what saith the answer of God unto him?  I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</P
><P
>5. Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</P
><P
>6. And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace.  But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</P
><P
>7. What then?  Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</P
><P
>8. (According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</P
><P
>9. And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling block, and a recompence unto them:</P
><P
>10. Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</P
><P
>11. I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall?  God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</P
><P
>12. Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</P
><P
>13. For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</P
><P
>14. If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</P
><P
>15. For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</P
><P
>16. For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</P
><P
>17. And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</P
><P
>18. Boast not against the branches.  But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</P
><P
>19. Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</P
><P
>20. Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith.  Be not highminded, but fear:</P
><P
>21. For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</P
><P
>22. Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</P
><P
>23. And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</P
><P
>24. For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</P
><P
>25. For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</P
><P
>26. And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</P
><P
>27. For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</P
><P
>28. As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.</P
><P
>29. For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</P
><P
>30. For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</P
><P
>31. Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</P
><P
>32. For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</P
><P
>33. O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!  how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</P
><P
>34. For who hath known the mind of the Lord?  or who hath been his counsellor?</P
><P
>35. Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</P
><P
>36. For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever.  Amen.</P
