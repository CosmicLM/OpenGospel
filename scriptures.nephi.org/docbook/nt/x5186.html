>6.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. WHAT shall we say then?  Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?</P
><P
>2. God forbid.  How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?</P
><P
>3. Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?</P
><P
>4. Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.</P
><P
>5. For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:</P
><P
>6. Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.</P
><P
>7. For he that is dead is freed from sin.</P
><P
>8. Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:</P
><P
>9. Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.</P
><P
>10. For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.</P
><P
>11. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.</P
><P
>12. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</P
><P
>13. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.</P
><P
>14. For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.</P
><P
>15. What then?  shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace?  God forbid.</P
><P
>16. Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?</P
><P
>17. But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.</P
><P
>18. Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.</P
><P
>19. I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.</P
><P
>20. For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.</P
><P
>21. What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed?  for the end of those things is death.</P
><P
>22. But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.</P
><P
>23. For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</P
