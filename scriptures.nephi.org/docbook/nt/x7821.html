>21.5. Chapter 5</H1
><P
>1. THE elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder, and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed:</P
><P
>2. Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind;</P
><P
>3. Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the flock.</P
><P
>4. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</P
><P
>5. Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder.  Yea, all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble.</P
><P
>6. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time:</P
><P
>7. Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.</P
><P
>8. Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:</P
><P
>9. Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world.</P
><P
>10. But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while, make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.</P
><P
>11. To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.  Amen.</P
><P
>12. By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the true grace of God wherein ye stand.</P
><P
>13. The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you, saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.</P
><P
>14. Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity.  Peace be with you all that are in Christ Jesus.  Amen.</P
