>8.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. BUT I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.</P
><P
>2. For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?</P
><P
>3. And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</P
><P
>4. For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you.</P
><P
>5. But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all.</P
><P
>6. Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.</P
><P
>7. So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.</P
><P
>8. Wherefore I beseech you that ye would confirm your love toward him.</P
><P
>9. For to this end also did I write, that I might know the proof of you, whether ye be obedient in all things.</P
><P
>10. To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;</P
><P
>11. Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.</P
><P
>12. Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,</P
><P
>13. I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia.</P
><P
>14. Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place.</P
><P
>15. For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:</P
><P
>16. To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life.  And who is sufficient for these things?</P
><P
>17. For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.</P
