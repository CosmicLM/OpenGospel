>6.14. Chapter 14</H1
><P
>1. HIM that is weak in the faith receive ye, but not to doubtful disputations.</P
><P
>2. For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs.</P
><P
>3. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not; and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth: for God hath received him.</P
><P
>4. Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?  to his own master he standeth or falleth.  Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand.</P
><P
>5. One man esteemeth one day above another: another esteemeth every day alike.  Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</P
><P
>6. He that regardeth the day, regardeth it unto the Lord; and he that regardeth not the day, to the Lord he doth not regard it.  He that eateth, eateth to the Lord, for he giveth God thanks; and he that eateth not, to the Lord he eateth not, and giveth God thanks.</P
><P
>7. For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself.</P
><P
>8. For whether we live, we live unto the Lord; and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</P
><P
>9. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</P
><P
>10. But why dost thou judge thy brother?  or why dost thou set at nought thy brother?  for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ.</P
><P
>11. For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.</P
><P
>12. So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God.</P
><P
>13. Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way.</P
><P
>14. I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean.</P
><P
>15. But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably.  Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died.</P
><P
>16. Let not then your good be evil spoken of:</P
><P
>17. For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost.</P
><P
>18. For he that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved of men.</P
><P
>19. Let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace, and things wherewith one may edify another.</P
><P
>20. For meat destroy not the work of God.  All things indeed are pure; but it is evil for that man who eateth with offence.</P
><P
>21. It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak.</P
><P
>22. Hast thou faith?  have it to thyself before God.  Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.</P
><P
>23. And he that doubteth is damned if he eat, because he eateth not of faith: for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.</P
