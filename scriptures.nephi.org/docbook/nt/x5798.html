>7.12. Chapter 12</H1
><P
>1. NOW concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</P
><P
>2. Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away unto these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</P
><P
>3. Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</P
><P
>4. Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.</P
><P
>5. And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord.</P
><P
>6. And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all.</P
><P
>7. But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.</P
><P
>8. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</P
><P
>9. To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</P
><P
>10. To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</P
><P
>11. But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.</P
><P
>12. For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</P
><P
>13. For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.</P
><P
>14. For the body is not one member, but many.</P
><P
>15. If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</P
><P
>16. And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</P
><P
>17. If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing?  If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</P
><P
>18. But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</P
><P
>19. And if they were all one member, where were the body?</P
><P
>20. But now are they many members, yet but one body.</P
><P
>21. And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</P
><P
>22. Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</P
><P
>23. And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.</P
><P
>24. For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:</P
><P
>25. That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.</P
><P
>26. And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</P
><P
>27. Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</P
><P
>28. And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues.</P
><P
>29. Are all apostles?  are all prophets?  are all teachers?  are all workers of miracles?</P
><P
>30. Have all the gifts of healing?  do all speak with tongues?  do all interpret?</P
><P
>31. But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet shew I unto you a more excellent way.</P
