>10.5. Chapter 5</H1
><P
>1. BE ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;</P
><P
>2. And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour.</P
><P
>3. But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;</P
><P
>4. Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.</P
><P
>5. For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God.</P
><P
>6. Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.</P
><P
>7. Be not ye therefore partakers with them.</P
><P
>8. For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:</P
><P
>9. (For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)</P
><P
>10. Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.</P
><P
>11. And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them.</P
><P
>12. For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.</P
><P
>13. But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.</P
><P
>14. Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</P
><P
>15. See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,</P
><P
>16. Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</P
><P
>17. Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is.</P
><P
>18. And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;</P
><P
>19. Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;</P
><P
>20. Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;</P
><P
>21. Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.</P
><P
>22. Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.</P
><P
>23. For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body.</P
><P
>24. Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing.</P
><P
>25. Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;</P
><P
>26. That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,</P
><P
>27. That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.</P
><P
>28. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.  He that loveth his wife loveth himself.</P
><P
>29. For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:</P
><P
>30. For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.</P
><P
>31. For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</P
><P
>32. This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.</P
><P
>33. Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.</P
