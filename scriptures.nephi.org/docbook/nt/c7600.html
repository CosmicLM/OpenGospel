><P
>1. JAMES, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.</P
><P
>2. My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations;</P
><P
>3. Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.</P
><P
>4. But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing.</P
><P
>5. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</P
><P
>6. But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering.  For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.</P
><P
>7. For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of the Lord.</P
><P
>8. A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.</P
><P
>9. Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:</P
><P
>10. But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away.</P
><P
>11. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.</P
><P
>12. Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath promised to them that love him.</P
><P
>13. Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</P
><P
>14. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed.</P
><P
>15. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin, when it is finished, bringeth forth death.</P
><P
>16. Do not err, my beloved brethren.</P
><P
>17. Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.</P
><P
>18. Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.</P
><P
>19. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:</P
><P
>20. For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.</P
><P
>21. Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.</P
><P
>22. But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.</P
><P
>23. For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:</P
><P
>24. For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was.</P
><P
>25. But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.</P
><P
>26. If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain.</P
><P
>27. Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.</P
