>1.15. Chapter 15</H1
><P
>1. THEN came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of Jerusalem, saying,</P
><P
>2. Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?  for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</P
><P
>3. But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?</P
><P
>4. For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.</P
><P
>5. But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;</P
><P
>6. And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.  Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</P
><P
>7. Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,</P
><P
>8. This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.</P
><P
>9. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</P
><P
>10. ¶ And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and understand:</P
><P
>11. Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</P
><P
>12. Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?</P
><P
>13. But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.</P
><P
>14. Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind.  And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</P
><P
>15. Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this parable.</P
><P
>16. And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?</P
><P
>17. Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?</P
><P
>18. But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and they defile the man.</P
><P
>19. For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:</P
><P
>20. These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not a man.</P
><P
>21. ¶ Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.</P
><P
>22. And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</P
><P
>23. But he answered her not a word.  And his disciples came and besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</P
><P
>24. But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</P
><P
>25. Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</P
><P
>26. But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.</P
><P
>27. And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</P
><P
>28. Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt.  And her daughter was made whole from that very hour.</P
><P
>29. And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</P
><P
>30. And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:</P
><P
>31. Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.</P
><P
>32. ¶ Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way.</P
><P
>33. And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?</P
><P
>34. And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye?  And they said, Seven, and a few little fishes.</P
><P
>35. And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</P
><P
>36. And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks, and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.</P
><P
>37. And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</P
><P
>38. And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and children.</P
><P
>39. And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the coasts of Magdala.</P
