>11.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. IF there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,</P
><P
>2. Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.</P
><P
>3. Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.</P
><P
>4. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others.</P
><P
>5. Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</P
><P
>6. Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:</P
><P
>7. But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:</P
><P
>8. And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.</P
><P
>9. Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:</P
><P
>10. That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;</P
><P
>11. And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</P
><P
>12. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.</P
><P
>13. For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</P
><P
>14. Do all things without murmurings and disputings:</P
><P
>15. That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;</P
><P
>16. Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither laboured in vain.</P
><P
>17. Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.</P
><P
>18. For the same cause also do ye joy, and rejoice with me.</P
><P
>19. But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</P
><P
>20. For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state.</P
><P
>21. For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</P
><P
>22. But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel.</P
><P
>23. Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.</P
><P
>24. But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.</P
><P
>25. Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labour, and fellowsoldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.</P
><P
>26. For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick.</P
><P
>27. For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</P
><P
>28. I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</P
><P
>29. Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:</P
><P
>30. Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.</P
