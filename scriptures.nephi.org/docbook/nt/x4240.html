>5.8. Chapter 8</H1
><P
>1. AND Saul was consenting unto his death.  And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.</P
><P
>2. And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.</P
><P
>3. As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</P
><P
>4. Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.</P
><P
>5. Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.</P
><P
>6. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</P
><P
>7. For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.</P
><P
>8. And there was great joy in that city.</P
><P
>9. But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:</P
><P
>10. To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.</P
><P
>11. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.</P
><P
>12. But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</P
><P
>13. Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.</P
><P
>14. Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:</P
><P
>15. Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost:</P
><P
>16. (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)</P
><P
>17. Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</P
><P
>18. And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money,</P
><P
>19. Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost.</P
><P
>20. But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</P
><P
>21. Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</P
><P
>22. Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</P
><P
>23. For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</P
><P
>24. Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</P
><P
>25. And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.</P
><P
>26. And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.</P
><P
>27. And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</P
><P
>28. Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet.</P
><P
>29. Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.</P
><P
>30. And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?</P
><P
>31. And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me?  And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</P
><P
>32. The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:</P
><P
>33. In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation?  for his life is taken from the earth.</P
><P
>34. And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this?  of himself, or of some other man?</P
><P
>35. Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.</P
><P
>36. And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?</P
><P
>37. And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest.  And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.</P
><P
>38. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</P
><P
>39. And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing.</P
><P
>40. But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</P
