>7.5. Chapter 5</H1
><P
>1. IT is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.</P
><P
>2. And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</P
><P
>3. For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,</P
><P
>4. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</P
><P
>5. To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</P
><P
>6. Your glorying is not good.  Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</P
><P
>7. Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened.  For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:</P
><P
>8. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</P
><P
>9. I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:</P
><P
>10. Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.</P
><P
>11. But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.</P
><P
>12. For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?  do not ye judge them that are within?</P
><P
>13. But them that are without God judgeth.  Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</P
