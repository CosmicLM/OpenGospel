>7.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. AND I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.</P
><P
>2. I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</P
><P
>3. For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?</P
><P
>4. For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</P
><P
>5. Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</P
><P
>6. I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.</P
><P
>7. So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</P
><P
>8. Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</P
><P
>9. For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.</P
><P
>10. According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon.  But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.</P
><P
>11. For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</P
><P
>12. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</P
><P
>13. Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.</P
><P
>14. If any man's work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</P
><P
>15. If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</P
><P
>16. Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</P
><P
>17. If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are.</P
><P
>18. Let no man deceive himself.  If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</P
><P
>19. For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.  For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</P
><P
>20. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</P
><P
>21. Therefore let no man glory in men.  For all things are yours;</P
><P
>22. Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</P
><P
>23. And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</P
