>15.1. Chapter 1</H1
><P
>1. PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;</P
><P
>2. Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</P
><P
>3. As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,</P
><P
>4. Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.</P
><P
>5. Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:</P
><P
>6. From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;</P
><P
>7. Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</P
><P
>8. But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;</P
><P
>9. Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,</P
><P
>10. For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;</P
><P
>11. According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust.</P
><P
>12. And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;</P
><P
>13. Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</P
><P
>14. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</P
><P
>15. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.</P
><P
>16. Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.</P
><P
>17. Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever.  Amen.</P
><P
>18. This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;</P
><P
>19. Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:</P
><P
>20. Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</P
