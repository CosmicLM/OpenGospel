>6.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. WHAT advantage then hath the Jew?  or what profit is there of circumcision?</P
><P
>2. Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God.</P
><P
>3. For what if some did not believe?  shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?</P
><P
>4. God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged.</P
><P
>5. But if our unrighteousness commend the righteousness of God, what shall we say?  Is God unrighteous who taketh vengeance?  (I speak as a man)</P
><P
>6. God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?</P
><P
>7. For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?</P
><P
>8. And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come?  whose damnation is just.</P
><P
>9. What then?  are we better than they?  No, in no wise: for we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin;</P
><P
>10. As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:</P
><P
>11. There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.</P
><P
>12. They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.</P
><P
>13. Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</P
><P
>14. Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:</P
><P
>15. Their feet are swift to shed blood:</P
><P
>16. Destruction and misery are in their ways:</P
><P
>17. And the way of peace have they not known:</P
><P
>18. There is no fear of God before their eyes.</P
><P
>19. Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</P
><P
>20. Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.</P
><P
>21. But now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the law and the prophets;</P
><P
>22. Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:</P
><P
>23. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</P
><P
>24. Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:</P
><P
>25. Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God;</P
><P
>26. To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus.</P
><P
>27. Where is boasting then?  It is excluded.  By what law?  of works?  Nay: but by the law of faith.</P
><P
>28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</P
><P
>29. Is he the God of the Jews only?  is he not also of the Gentiles?  Yes, of the Gentiles also:</P
><P
>30. Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith.</P
><P
>31. Do we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.</P
