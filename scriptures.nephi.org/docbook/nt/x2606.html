>3.16. Chapter 16</H1
><P
>1. AND he said also unto his disciples, There was a certain rich man, which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods.</P
><P
>2. And he called him, and said unto him, How is it that I hear this of thee?  give an account of thy stewardship; for thou mayest be no longer steward.</P
><P
>3. Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do?  for my lord taketh away from me the stewardship: I cannot dig; to beg I am ashamed.</P
><P
>4. I am resolved what to do, that, when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses.</P
><P
>5. So he called every one of his lord's debtors unto him, and said unto the first, How much owest thou unto my lord?</P
><P
>6. And he said, An hundred measures of oil.  And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and sit down quickly, and write fifty.</P
><P
>7. Then said he to another, And how much owest thou?  And he said, An hundred measures of wheat.  And he said unto him, Take thy bill, and write fourscore.</P
><P
>8. And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light.</P
><P
>9. And I say unto you, Make to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitations.</P
><P
>10. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.</P
><P
>11. If therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches?</P
><P
>12. And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own?</P
><P
>13. ¶ No servant can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other.  Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</P
><P
>14. And the Pharisees also, who were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him.</P
><P
>15. And he said unto them, Ye are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.</P
><P
>16. The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.</P
><P
>17. And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fail.</P
><P
>18. Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery.</P
><P
>19. ¶ There was a certain rich man, which was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared sumptuously every day:</P
><P
>20. And there was a certain beggar named Lazarus, which was laid at his gate, full of sores,</P
><P
>21. And desiring to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: moreover the dogs came and licked his sores.</P
><P
>22. And it came to pass, that the beggar died, and was carried by the angels into Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried;</P
><P
>23. And in hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom.</P
><P
>24. And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tormented in this flame.</P
><P
>25. But Abraham said, Son, remember that thou in thy lifetime receivedst thy good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</P
><P
>26. And beside all this, between us and you there is a great gulf fixed: so that they which would pass from hence to you cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.</P
><P
>27. Then he said, I pray thee therefore, father, that thou wouldest send him to my father's house:</P
><P
>28. For I have five brethren; that he may testify unto them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</P
><P
>29. Abraham saith unto him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.</P
><P
>30. And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</P
><P
>31. And he said unto him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.</P
