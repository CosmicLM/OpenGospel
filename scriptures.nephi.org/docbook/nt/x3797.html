>4.17. Chapter 17</H1
><P
>1. THESE words spake Jesus, and lifted up his eyes to heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come; glorify thy Son, that thy Son also may glorify thee:</P
><P
>2. As thou hast given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as thou hast given him.</P
><P
>3. And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.</P
><P
>4. I have glorified thee on the earth: I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do.</P
><P
>5. And now, O Father, glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was.</P
><P
>6. I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world: thine they were, and thou gavest them me; and they have kept thy word.</P
><P
>7. Now they have known that all things whatsoever thou hast given me are of thee.</P
><P
>8. For I have given unto them the words which thou gavest me; and they have received them, and have known surely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didst send me.</P
><P
>9. I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me; for they are thine.</P
><P
>10. And all mine are thine, and thine are mine; and I am glorified in them.</P
><P
>11. And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to thee.  Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.</P
><P
>12. While I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name: those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.</P
><P
>13. And now come I to thee; and these things I speak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themselves.</P
><P
>14. I have given them thy word; and the world hath hated them, because they are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</P
><P
>15. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that thou shouldest keep them from the evil.</P
><P
>16. They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world.</P
><P
>17. Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth.</P
><P
>18. As thou hast sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.</P
><P
>19. And for their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also might be sanctified through the truth.</P
><P
>20. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;</P
><P
>21. That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me.</P
><P
>22. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one:</P
><P
>23. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me.</P
><P
>24. Father, I will that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me where I am; that they may behold my glory, which thou hast given me: for thou lovedst me before the foundation of the world.</P
><P
>25. O righteous Father, the world hath not known thee: but I have known thee, and these have known that thou hast sent me.</P
><P
>26. And I have declared unto them thy name, and will declare it: that the love wherewith thou hast loved me may be in them, and I in them.</P
