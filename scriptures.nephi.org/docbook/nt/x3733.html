>4.15. Chapter 15</H1
><P
>1. I AM the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman.</P
><P
>2. Every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.</P
><P
>3. Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you.</P
><P
>4. Abide in me, and I in you.  As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except ye abide in me.</P
><P
>5. I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing.</P
><P
>6. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned.</P
><P
>7. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.</P
><P
>8. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples.</P
><P
>9. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.</P
><P
>10. If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</P
><P
>11. These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</P
><P
>12. This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</P
><P
>13. Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</P
><P
>14. Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.</P
><P
>15. Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.</P
><P
>16. Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</P
><P
>17. These things I command you, that ye love one another.</P
><P
>18. If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.</P
><P
>19. If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</P
><P
>20. Remember the word that I said unto you, The servant is not greater than his lord.  If they have persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they have kept my saying, they will keep yours also.</P
><P
>21. But all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake, because they know not him that sent me.</P
><P
>22. If I had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had sin: but now they have no cloke for their sin.</P
><P
>23. He that hateth me hateth my Father also.</P
><P
>24. If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin: but now have they both seen and hated both me and my Father.</P
><P
>25. But this cometh to pass, that the word might be fulfilled that is written in their law, They hated me without a cause.</P
><P
>26. But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall testify of me:</P
><P
>27. And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been with me from the beginning.</P
