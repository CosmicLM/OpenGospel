>17.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. PUT them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,</P
><P
>2. To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle, shewing all meekness unto all men.</P
><P
>3. For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</P
><P
>4. But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward man appeared,</P
><P
>5. Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;</P
><P
>6. Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</P
><P
>7. That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</P
><P
>8. This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works.  These things are good and profitable unto men.</P
><P
>9. But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and vain.</P
><P
>10. A man that is an heretick after the first and second admonition reject;</P
><P
>11. Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself.</P
><P
>12. When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.</P
><P
>13. Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.</P
><P
>14. And let ours also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.</P
><P
>15. All that are with me salute thee.  Greet them that love us in the faith.  Grace be with you all.  Amen.</P
