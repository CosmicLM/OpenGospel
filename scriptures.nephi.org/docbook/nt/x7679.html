>20.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. FROM whence come wars and fightings among you?  come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?</P
><P
>2. Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.</P
><P
>3. Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.</P
><P
>4. Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God?  whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.</P
><P
>5. Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?</P
><P
>6. But he giveth more grace.  Wherefore he saith, God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.</P
><P
>7. Submit yourselves therefore to God.  Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.</P
><P
>8. Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you.  Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.</P
><P
>9. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.</P
><P
>10. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.</P
><P
>11. Speak not evil one of another, brethren.  He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge.</P
><P
>12. There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</P
><P
>13. Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and get gain:</P
><P
>14. Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow.  For what is your life?  It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away.</P
><P
>15. For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that.</P
><P
>16. But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is evil.</P
><P
>17. Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin.</P
