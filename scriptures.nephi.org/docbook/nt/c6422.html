>1. PAUL, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:</P
><P
>2. Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</P
><P
>3. Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:</P
><P
>4. According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:</P
><P
>5. Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,</P
><P
>6. To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved.</P
><P
>7. In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;</P
><P
>8. Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;</P
><P
>9. Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:</P
><P
>10. That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:</P
><P
>11. In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:</P
><P
>12. That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ.</P
><P
>13. In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,</P
><P
>14. Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory.</P
><P
>15. Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,</P
><P
>16. Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;</P
><P
>17. That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:</P
><P
>18. The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,</P
><P
>19. And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,</P
><P
>20. Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,</P
><P
>21. Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:</P
><P
>22. And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,</P
><P
>23. Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all.</P
