>1.1. Chapter 1</H1
><P
>1. THE book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</P
><P
>2. Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;</P
><P
>3. And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;</P
><P
>4. And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;</P
><P
>5. And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;</P
><P
>6. And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;</P
><P
>7. And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;</P
><P
>8. And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;</P
><P
>9. And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</P
><P
>10. And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;</P
><P
>11. And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:</P
><P
>12. And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;</P
><P
>13. And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;</P
><P
>14. And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;</P
><P
>15. And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;</P
><P
>16. And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</P
><P
>17. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.</P
><P
>18. ¶ Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</P
><P
>19. Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</P
><P
>20. But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.</P
><P
>21. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</P
><P
>22. Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,</P
><P
>23. Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</P
><P
>24. Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:</P
><P
>25. And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</P
