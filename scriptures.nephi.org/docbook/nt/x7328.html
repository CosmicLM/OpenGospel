>19.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. LET us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short of it.</P
><P
>2. For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</P
><P
>3. For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world.</P
><P
>4. For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.</P
><P
>5. And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.</P
><P
>6. Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein, and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because of unbelief:</P
><P
>7. Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day, after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.</P
><P
>8. For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.</P
><P
>9. There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.</P
><P
>10. For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from his own works, as God did from his.</P
><P
>11. Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief.</P
><P
>12. For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.</P
><P
>13. Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</P
><P
>14. Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession.</P
><P
>15. For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</P
><P
>16. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.</P
