><P
>1. THE elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known the truth;</P
><P
>2. For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with us for ever.</P
><P
>3. Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.</P
><P
>4. I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</P
><P
>5. And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, that we love one another.</P
><P
>6. And this is love, that we walk after his commandments.  This is the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walk in it.</P
><P
>7. For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh.  This is a deceiver and an antichrist.</P
><P
>8. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.</P
><P
>9. Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God.  He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.</P
><P
>10. If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:</P
><P
>11. For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.</P
><P
>12. Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face, that our joy may be full.</P
><P
>13. The children of thy elect sister greet thee.  Amen.</P
