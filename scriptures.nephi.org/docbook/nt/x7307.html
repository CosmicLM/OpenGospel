>19.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. WHEREFORE, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;</P
><P
>2. Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house.</P
><P
>3. For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house.</P
><P
>4. For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all things is God.</P
><P
>5. And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;</P
><P
>6. But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end.</P
><P
>7. Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his voice,</P
><P
>8. Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</P
><P
>9. When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years.</P
><P
>10. Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.</P
><P
>11. So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)</P
><P
>12. Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.</P
><P
>13. But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</P
><P
>14. For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning of our confidence stedfast unto the end;</P
><P
>15. While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.</P
><P
>16. For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all that came out of Egypt by Moses.</P
><P
>17. But with whom was he grieved forty years?  was it not with them that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?</P
><P
>18. And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that believed not?</P
><P
>19. So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.</P
