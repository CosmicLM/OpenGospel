><P
>1. PAUL, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;</P
><P
>2. In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;</P
><P
>3. But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;</P
><P
>4. To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour.</P
><P
>5. For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:</P
><P
>6. If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.</P
><P
>7. For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;</P
><P
>8. But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;</P
><P
>9. Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.</P
><P
>10. For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:</P
><P
>11. Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.</P
><P
>12. One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.</P
><P
>13. This witness is true.  Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;</P
><P
>14. Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.</P
><P
>15. Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.</P
><P
>16. They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate.</P
