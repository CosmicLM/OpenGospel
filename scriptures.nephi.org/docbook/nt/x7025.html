>15.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. NOW the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</P
><P
>2. Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;</P
><P
>3. Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.</P
><P
>4. For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:</P
><P
>5. For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</P
><P
>6. If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained.</P
><P
>7. But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness.</P
><P
>8. For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</P
><P
>9. This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.</P
><P
>10. For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe.</P
><P
>11. These things command and teach.</P
><P
>12. Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</P
><P
>13. Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</P
><P
>14. Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery.</P
><P
>15. Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.</P
><P
>16. Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee.</P
