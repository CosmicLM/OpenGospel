>22.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. THIS second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:</P
><P
>2. That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the apostles of the Lord and Saviour:</P
><P
>3. Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,</P
><P
>4. And saying, Where is the promise of his coming?  for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.</P
><P
>5. For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the water and in the water:</P
><P
>6. Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water, perished:</P
><P
>7. But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men.</P
><P
>8. But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</P
><P
>9. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</P
><P
>10. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up.</P
><P
>11. Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness,</P
><P
>12. Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?</P
><P
>13. Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.</P
><P
>14. Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot, and blameless.</P
><P
>15. And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation; even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom given unto him hath written unto you;</P
><P
>16. As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, unto their own destruction.</P
><P
>17. Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before, beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.</P
><P
>18. But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.  To him be glory both now and for ever.  Amen.</P
