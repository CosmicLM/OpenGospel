>20.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. MY brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.</P
><P
>2. For in many things we offend all.  If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</P
><P
>3. Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.</P
><P
>4. Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.</P
><P
>5. Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great things.  Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</P
><P
>6. And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.</P
><P
>7. For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind:</P
><P
>8. But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</P
><P
>9. Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.</P
><P
>10. Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing.  My brethren, these things ought not so to be.</P
><P
>11. Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and bitter?</P
><P
>12. Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries?  either a vine, figs?  so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</P
><P
>13. Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you?  let him shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom.</P
><P
>14. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth.</P
><P
>15. This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.</P
><P
>16. For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.</P
><P
>17. But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.</P
><P
>18. And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.</P
