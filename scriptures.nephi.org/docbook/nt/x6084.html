>8.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. WE then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</P
><P
>2. (For he saith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.)</P
><P
>3. Giving no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:</P
><P
>4. But in all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in necessities, in distresses,</P
><P
>5. In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;</P
><P
>6. By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,</P
><P
>7. By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,</P
><P
>8. By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;</P
><P
>9. As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;</P
><P
>10. As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</P
><P
>11. O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged.</P
><P
>12. Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels.</P
><P
>13. Now for a recompence in the same, (I speak as unto my children,) be ye also enlarged.</P
><P
>14. Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness?  and what communion hath light with darkness?</P
><P
>15. And what concord hath Christ with Belial?  or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?</P
><P
>16. And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols?  for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</P
><P
>17. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you,</P
><P
>18. And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.</P
