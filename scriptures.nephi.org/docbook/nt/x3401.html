>4.8. Chapter 8</H1
><P
>1. JESUS went unto the mount of Olives.</P
><P
>2. And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught them.</P
><P
>3. And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,</P
><P
>4. They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, in the very act.</P
><P
>5. Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what sayest thou?</P
><P
>6. This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him.  But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.</P
><P
>7. So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.</P
><P
>8. And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.</P
><P
>9. And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.</P
><P
>10. When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman, he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath no man condemned thee?</P
><P
>11. She said, No man, Lord.  And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.</P
><P
>12. ¶ Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</P
><P
>13. The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of thyself; thy record is not true.</P
><P
>14. Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go.</P
><P
>15. Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.</P
><P
>16. And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent me.</P
><P
>17. It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.</P
><P
>18. I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent me beareth witness of me.</P
><P
>19. Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father?  Jesus answered, Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also.</P
><P
>20. These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</P
><P
>21. Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come.</P
><P
>22. Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself?  because he saith, Whither I go, ye cannot come.</P
><P
>23. And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above: ye are of this world; I am not of this world.</P
><P
>24. I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.</P
><P
>25. Then said they unto him, Who art thou?  And Jesus saith unto them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.</P
><P
>26. I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I have heard of him.</P
><P
>27. They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.</P
><P
>28. Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.</P
><P
>29. And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.</P
><P
>30. As he spake these words, many believed on him.</P
><P
>31. Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;</P
><P
>32. And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.</P
><P
>33. ¶ They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?</P
><P
>34. Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin.</P
><P
>35. And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son abideth ever.</P
><P
>36. If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed.</P
><P
>37. I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me, because my word hath no place in you.</P
><P
>38. I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which ye have seen with your father.</P
><P
>39. They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father.  Jesus saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do the works of Abraham.</P
><P
>40. But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.</P
><P
>41. Ye do the deeds of your father.  Then said they to him, We be not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.</P
><P
>42. Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he sent me.</P
><P
>43. Why do ye not understand my speech?  even because ye cannot hear my word.</P
><P
>44. Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do.  He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him.  When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.</P
><P
>45. And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.</P
><P
>46. Which of you convinceth me of sin?  And if I say the truth, why do ye not believe me?</P
><P
>47. He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.</P
><P
>48. Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?</P
><P
>49. Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father, and ye do dishonour me.</P
><P
>50. And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and judgeth.</P
><P
>51. Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.</P
><P
>52. Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a devil.  Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.</P
><P
>53. Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead?  and the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?</P
><P
>54. Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is your God:</P
><P
>55. Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I know him, and keep his saying.</P
><P
>56. Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</P
><P
>57. Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham?</P
><P
>58. Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was, I am.</P
><P
>59. Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst of them, and so passed by.</P
