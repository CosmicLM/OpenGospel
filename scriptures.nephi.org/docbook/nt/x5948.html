>7.16. Chapter 16</H1
><P
>1. NOW concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</P
><P
>2. Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.</P
><P
>3. And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem.</P
><P
>4. And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.</P
><P
>5. Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.</P
><P
>6. And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.</P
><P
>7. For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.</P
><P
>8. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.</P
><P
>9. For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.</P
><P
>10. Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do.</P
><P
>11. Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren.</P
><P
>12. As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.</P
><P
>13. Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong.</P
><P
>14. Let all your things be done with charity.</P
><P
>15. I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)</P
><P
>16. That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth.</P
><P
>17. I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.</P
><P
>18. For they have refreshed my spirit and yours: therefore acknowledge ye them that are such.</P
><P
>19. The churches of Asia salute you.  Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house.</P
><P
>20. All the brethren greet you.  Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.</P
><P
>21. The salutation of me Paul with mine own hand.</P
><P
>22. If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maran-atha.</P
><P
>23. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</P
><P
>24. My love be with you all in Christ Jesus.  Amen.</P
