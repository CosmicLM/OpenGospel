>20.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. MY brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.</P
><P
>2. For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring, in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile raiment;</P
><P
>3. And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:</P
><P
>4. Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges of evil thoughts?</P
><P
>5. Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him?</P
><P
>6. But ye have despised the poor.  Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?</P
><P
>7. Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are called?</P
><P
>8. If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:</P
><P
>9. But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.</P
><P
>10. For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.</P
><P
>11. For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.  Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou art become a transgressor of the law.</P
><P
>12. So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.</P
><P
>13. For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.</P
><P
>14. What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works?  can faith save him?</P
><P
>15. If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,</P
><P
>16. And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?</P
><P
>17. Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</P
><P
>18. Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works.</P
><P
>19. Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</P
><P
>20. But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?</P
><P
>21. Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</P
><P
>22. Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?</P
><P
>23. And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.</P
><P
>24. Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.</P
><P
>25. Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?</P
><P
>26. For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.</P
