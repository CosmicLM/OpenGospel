>9.5. Chapter 5</H1
><P
>1. STAND fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</P
><P
>2. Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.</P
><P
>3. For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</P
><P
>4. Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.</P
><P
>5. For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.</P
><P
>6. For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.</P
><P
>7. Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?</P
><P
>8. This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.</P
><P
>9. A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</P
><P
>10. I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</P
><P
>11. And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution?  then is the offence of the cross ceased.</P
><P
>12. I would they were even cut off which trouble you.</P
><P
>13. For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.</P
><P
>14. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</P
><P
>15. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</P
><P
>16. This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</P
><P
>17. For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</P
><P
>18. But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</P
><P
>19. Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</P
><P
>20. Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,</P
><P
>21. Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</P
><P
>22. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,</P
><P
>23. Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</P
><P
>24. And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.</P
><P
>25. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.</P
><P
>26. Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.</P
