>23.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. BEHOLD, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.</P
><P
>2. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</P
><P
>3. And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself, even as he is pure.</P
><P
>4. Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law.</P
><P
>5. And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.</P
><P
>6. Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath not seen him, neither known him.</P
><P
>7. Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.</P
><P
>8. He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth from the beginning.  For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.</P
><P
>9. Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God.</P
><P
>10. In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.</P
><P
>11. For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.</P
><P
>12. Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.  And wherefore slew he him?  Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.</P
><P
>13. Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.</P
><P
>14. We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we love the brethren.  He that loveth not his brother abideth in death.</P
><P
>15. Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.</P
><P
>16. Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren.</P
><P
>17. But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</P
><P
>18. My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but in deed and in truth.</P
><P
>19. And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure our hearts before him.</P
><P
>20. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things.</P
><P
>21. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence toward God.</P
><P
>22. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight.</P
><P
>23. And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment.</P
><P
>24. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</P
