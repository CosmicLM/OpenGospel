>4.14. Chapter 14</H1
><P
>1. LET not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me.</P
><P
>2. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you.  I go to prepare a place for you.</P
><P
>3. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also.</P
><P
>4. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know.</P
><P
>5. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way?</P
><P
>6. Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.</P
><P
>7. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.</P
><P
>8. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</P
><P
>9. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?  he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?</P
><P
>10. Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?  the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.</P
><P
>11. Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me: or else believe me for the very works' sake.</P
><P
>12. Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go unto my Father.</P
><P
>13. And whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.</P
><P
>14. If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.</P
><P
>15. ¶ If ye love me, keep my commandments.</P
><P
>16. And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;</P
><P
>17. Even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</P
><P
>18. I will not leave you comfortless: I will come to you.</P
><P
>19. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also.</P
><P
>20. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.</P
><P
>21. He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.</P
><P
>22. Judas saith unto him, not Iscariot, Lord, how is it that thou wilt manifest thyself unto us, and not unto the world?</P
><P
>23. Jesus answered and said unto him, If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</P
><P
>24. He that loveth me not keepeth not my sayings: and the word which ye hear is not mine, but the Father's which sent me.</P
><P
>25. These things have I spoken unto you, being yet present with you.</P
><P
>26. But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.</P
><P
>27. Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you.  Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.</P
><P
>28. Ye have heard how I said unto you, I go away, and come again unto you.  If ye loved me, ye would rejoice, because I said, I go unto the Father: for my Father is greater than I.</P
><P
>29. And now I have told you before it come to pass, that, when it is come to pass, ye might believe.</P
><P
>30. Hereafter I will not talk much with you: for the prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me.</P
><P
>31. But that the world may know that I love the Father; and as the Father gave me commandment, even so I do.  Arise, let us go hence.</P
