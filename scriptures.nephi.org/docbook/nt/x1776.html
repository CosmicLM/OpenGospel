>2.15. Chapter 15</H1
><P
>1. AND straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</P
><P
>2. And Pilate asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews?  And he answering said unto him, Thou sayest it.</P
><P
>3. And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing.</P
><P
>4. And Pilate asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing?  behold how many things they witness against thee.</P
><P
>5. But Jesus yet answered nothing; so that Pilate marvelled.</P
><P
>6. Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired.</P
><P
>7. And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.</P
><P
>8. And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them.</P
><P
>9. But Pilate answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</P
><P
>10. For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy.</P
><P
>11. But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release Barabbas unto them.</P
><P
>12. And Pilate answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews?</P
><P
>13. And they cried out again, Crucify him.</P
><P
>14. Then Pilate said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done?  And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him.</P
><P
>15. ¶ And so Pilate, willing to content the people, released Barabbas unto them, and delivered Jesus, when he had scourged him, to be crucified.</P
><P
>16. And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band.</P
><P
>17. And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,</P
><P
>18. And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews!</P
><P
>19. And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him.</P
><P
>20. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him.</P
><P
>21. And they compel one Simon a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross.</P
><P
>22. And they bring him unto the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull.</P
><P
>23. And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not.</P
><P
>24. And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take.</P
><P
>25. And it was the third hour, and they crucified him.</P
><P
>26. And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</P
><P
>27. And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left.</P
><P
>28. And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors.</P
><P
>29. And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days,</P
><P
>30. Save thyself, and come down from the cross.</P
><P
>31. Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save.</P
><P
>32. Let Christ the King of Israel descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.  And they that were crucified with him reviled him.</P
><P
>33. And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</P
><P
>34. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?  which is, being interpreted, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</P
><P
>35. And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias.</P
><P
>36. And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down.</P
><P
>37. And Jesus cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost.</P
><P
>38. And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</P
><P
>39. ¶ And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God.</P
><P
>40. There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</P
><P
>41. (Who also, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto Jerusalem.</P
><P
>42. ¶ And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</P
><P
>43. Joseph of Arimathaea, and honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto Pilate, and craved the body of Jesus.</P
><P
>44. And Pilate marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead.</P
><P
>45. And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to Joseph.</P
><P
>46. And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre.</P
><P
>47. And Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses beheld where he was laid.</P
