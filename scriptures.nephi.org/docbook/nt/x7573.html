>19.13. Chapter 13</H1
><P
>1. LET brotherly love continue.</P
><P
>2. Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.</P
><P
>3. Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.</P
><P
>4. Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.</P
><P
>5. Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</P
><P
>6. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.</P
><P
>7. Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation.</P
><P
>8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.</P
><P
>9. Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines.  For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats, which have not profited them that have been occupied therein.</P
><P
>10. We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.</P
><P
>11. For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without the camp.</P
><P
>12. Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with his own blood, suffered without the gate.</P
><P
>13. Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his reproach.</P
><P
>14. For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.</P
><P
>15. By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.</P
><P
>16. But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</P
><P
>17. Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves: for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is unprofitable for you.</P
><P
>18. Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all things willing to live honestly.</P
><P
>19. But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.</P
><P
>20. Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,</P
><P
>21. Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.</P
><P
>22. And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation: for I have written a letter unto you in few words.</P
><P
>23. Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you.</P
><P
>24. Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints.  They of Italy salute you.</P
><P
>25. Grace be with you all.  Amen.</P
