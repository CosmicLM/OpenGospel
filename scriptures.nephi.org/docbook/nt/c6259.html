><P
>1. PAUL, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead;)</P
><P
>2. And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</P
><P
>3. Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,</P
><P
>4. Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:</P
><P
>5. To whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.</P
><P
>6. I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:</P
><P
>7. Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</P
><P
>8. But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.</P
><P
>9. As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.</P
><P
>10. For do I now persuade men, or God?  or do I seek to please men?  for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</P
><P
>11. But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.</P
><P
>12. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.</P
><P
>13. For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:</P
><P
>14. And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.</P
><P
>15. But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</P
><P
>16. To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:</P
><P
>17. Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.</P
><P
>18. Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.</P
><P
>19. But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.</P
><P
>20. Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</P
><P
>21. Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</P
><P
>22. And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</P
><P
>23. But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.</P
><P
>24. And they glorified God in me.</P
