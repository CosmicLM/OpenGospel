>10.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. CHILDREN, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.</P
><P
>2. Honour thy father and mother; (which is the first commandment with promise;)</P
><P
>3. That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth.</P
><P
>4. And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</P
><P
>5. Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;</P
><P
>6. Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;</P
><P
>7. With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:</P
><P
>8. Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free.</P
><P
>9. And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him.</P
><P
>10. Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might.</P
><P
>11. Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil.</P
><P
>12. For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.</P
><P
>13. Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.</P
><P
>14. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;</P
><P
>15. And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</P
><P
>16. Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</P
><P
>17. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:</P
><P
>18. Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;</P
><P
>19. And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,</P
><P
>20. For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.</P
><P
>21. But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:</P
><P
>22. Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts.</P
><P
>23. Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</P
><P
>24. Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity.  Amen.</P
