>17.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. BUT speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:</P
><P
>2. That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience.</P
><P
>3. The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;</P
><P
>4. That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,</P
><P
>5. To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.</P
><P
>6. Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.</P
><P
>7. In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,</P
><P
>8. Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of you.</P
><P
>9. Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to please them well in all things; not answering again;</P
><P
>10. Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</P
><P
>11. For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,</P
><P
>12. Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;</P
><P
>13. Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;</P
><P
>14. Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</P
><P
>15. These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.  Let no man despise thee.</P
