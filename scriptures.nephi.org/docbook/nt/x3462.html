>4.9. Chapter 9</H1
><P
>1. AND as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth.</P
><P
>2. And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</P
><P
>3. Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.</P
><P
>4. I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work.</P
><P
>5. As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</P
><P
>6. When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,</P
><P
>7. And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.</P
><P
>8. ¶ The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?</P
><P
>9. Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he.</P
><P
>10. Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?</P
><P
>11. He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.</P
><P
>12. Then said they unto him, Where is he?  He said, I know not.</P
><P
>13. ¶ They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.</P
><P
>14. And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes.</P
><P
>15. Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight.  He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see.</P
><P
>16. Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day.  Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles?  And there was a division among them.</P
><P
>17. They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes?  He said, He is a prophet.</P
><P
>18. But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight.</P
><P
>19. And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind?  how then doth he now see?</P
><P
>20. His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</P
><P
>21. But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself.</P
><P
>22. These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.</P
><P
>23. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.</P
><P
>24. Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.</P
><P
>25. He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.</P
><P
>26. Then said they to him again, What did he to thee?  how opened he thine eyes?</P
><P
>27. He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again?  will ye also be his disciples?</P
><P
>28. Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are Moses' disciples.</P
><P
>29. We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is.</P
><P
>30. The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes.</P
><P
>31. Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth.</P
><P
>32. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind.</P
><P
>33. If this man were not of God, he could do nothing.</P
><P
>34. They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us?  And they cast him out.</P
><P
>35. Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?</P
><P
>36. He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?</P
><P
>37. And Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</P
><P
>38. And he said, Lord, I believe.  And he worshipped him.</P
><P
>39. ¶ And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind.</P
><P
>40. And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?</P
><P
>41. Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth.</P
