>16.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. I CHARGE thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;</P
><P
>2. Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.</P
><P
>3. For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;</P
><P
>4. And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.</P
><P
>5. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.</P
><P
>6. For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.</P
><P
>7. I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:</P
><P
>8. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing.</P
><P
>9. Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:</P
><P
>10. For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia.</P
><P
>11. Only Luke is with me.  Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry.</P
><P
>12. And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.</P
><P
>13. The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.</P
><P
>14. Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:</P
><P
>15. Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.</P
><P
>16. At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.</P
><P
>17. Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</P
><P
>18. And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever.  Amen.</P
><P
>19. Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.</P
><P
>20. Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.</P
><P
>21. Do thy diligence to come before winter.  Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</P
><P
>22. The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.  Grace be with you.  Amen.</P
