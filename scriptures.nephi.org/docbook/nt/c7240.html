>18.1. Chapter 1</H1
><P
>1. PAUL, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,</P
><P
>2. And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:</P
><P
>3. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</P
><P
>4. I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,</P
><P
>5. Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;</P
><P
>6. That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.</P
><P
>7. For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.</P
><P
>8. Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,</P
><P
>9. Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.</P
><P
>10. I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:</P
><P
>11. Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now profitable to thee and to me:</P
><P
>12. Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:</P
><P
>13. Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:</P
><P
>14. But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.</P
><P
>15. For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;</P
><P
>16. Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?</P
><P
>17. If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.</P
><P
>18. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;</P
><P
>19. I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides.</P
><P
>20. Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.</P
><P
>21. Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say.</P
><P
>22. But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.</P
><P
>23. There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;</P
><P
>24. Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.</P
><P
>25. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</P
