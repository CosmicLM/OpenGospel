>6.12. Chapter 12</H1
><P
>1. I BESEECH you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service.</P
><P
>2. And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.</P
><P
>3. For I say, through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith.</P
><P
>4. For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:</P
><P
>5. So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another.</P
><P
>6. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;</P
><P
>7. Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teacheth, on teaching;</P
><P
>8. Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness.</P
><P
>9. Let love be without dissimulation.  Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good.</P
><P
>10. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; in honour preferring one another;</P
><P
>11. Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;</P
><P
>12. Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;</P
><P
>13. Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.</P
><P
>14. Bless them which persecute you: bless, and curse not.</P
><P
>15. Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep.</P
><P
>16. Be of the same mind one toward another.  Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate.  Be not wise in your own conceits.</P
><P
>17. Recompense to no man evil for evil.  Provide things honest in the sight of all men.</P
><P
>18. If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men.</P
><P
>19. Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.</P
><P
>20. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head.</P
><P
>21. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</P
