>15.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. I EXHORT therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;</P
><P
>2. For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</P
><P
>3. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;</P
><P
>4. Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.</P
><P
>5. For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</P
><P
>6. Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.</P
><P
>7. Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.</P
><P
>8. I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</P
><P
>9. In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;</P
><P
>10. But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.</P
><P
>11. Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.</P
><P
>12. But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.</P
><P
>13. For Adam was first formed, then Eve.</P
><P
>14. And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.</P
><P
>15. Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.</P
