>13.5. Chapter 5</H1
><P
>1. BUT of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.</P
><P
>2. For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.</P
><P
>3. For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</P
><P
>4. But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.</P
><P
>5. Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.</P
><P
>6. Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.</P
><P
>7. For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.</P
><P
>8. But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.</P
><P
>9. For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,</P
><P
>10. Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.</P
><P
>11. Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.</P
><P
>12. And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;</P
><P
>13. And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake.  And be at peace among yourselves.</P
><P
>14. Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.</P
><P
>15. See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.</P
><P
>16. Rejoice evermore.</P
><P
>17. Pray without ceasing.</P
><P
>18. In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.</P
><P
>19. Quench not the Spirit.</P
><P
>20. Despise not prophesyings.</P
><P
>21. Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.</P
><P
>22. Abstain from all appearance of evil.</P
><P
>23. And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P
><P
>24. Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.</P
><P
>25. Brethren, pray for us.</P
><P
>26. Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.</P
><P
>27. I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.</P
><P
>28. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  Amen.</P
