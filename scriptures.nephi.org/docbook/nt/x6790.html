>12.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. MASTERS, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven.</P
><P
>2. Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;</P
><P
>3. Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:</P
><P
>4. That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</P
><P
>5. Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time.</P
><P
>6. Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man.</P
><P
>7. All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:</P
><P
>8. Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;</P
><P
>9. With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you.  They shall make known unto you all things which are done here.</P
><P
>10. Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)</P
><P
>11. And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision.  These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me.</P
><P
>12. Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.</P
><P
>13. For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.</P
><P
>14. Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.</P
><P
>15. Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.</P
><P
>16. And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea.</P
><P
>17. And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it.</P
><P
>18. The salutation by the hand of me Paul.  Remember my bonds.  Grace be with you.  Amen.</P
