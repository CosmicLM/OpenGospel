>1.25. Chapter 25</H1
><P
>1. THEN shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</P
><P
>2. And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</P
><P
>3. They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:</P
><P
>4. But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</P
><P
>5. While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</P
><P
>6. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.</P
><P
>7. Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</P
><P
>8. And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.</P
><P
>9. But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.</P
><P
>10. And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</P
><P
>11. Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.</P
><P
>12. But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</P
><P
>13. Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.</P
><P
>14. ¶ For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his goods.</P
><P
>15. And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one; to every man according to his several ability; and straightway took his journey.</P
><P
>16. Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with the same, and made them other five talents.</P
><P
>17. And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</P
><P
>18. But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and hid his lord's money.</P
><P
>19. After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and reckoneth with them.</P
><P
>20. And so he that had received five talents came and brought other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents: behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</P
><P
>21. His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</P
><P
>22. He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other talents beside them.</P
><P
>23. His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</P
><P
>24. Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strawed:</P
><P
>25. And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is thine.</P
><P
>26. His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where I have not strawed:</P
><P
>27. Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury.</P
><P
>28. Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</P
><P
>29. For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he hath.</P
><P
>30. And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</P
><P
>31. ¶ When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</P
><P
>32. And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats:</P
><P
>33. And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</P
><P
>34. Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</P
><P
>35. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</P
><P
>36. Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</P
><P
>37. Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed thee?  or thirsty, and gave thee drink?</P
><P
>38. When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in?  or naked, and clothed thee?</P
><P
>39. Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</P
><P
>40. And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</P
><P
>41. Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</P
><P
>42. For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</P
><P
>43. I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</P
><P
>44. Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</P
><P
>45. Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</P
><P
>46. And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</P
