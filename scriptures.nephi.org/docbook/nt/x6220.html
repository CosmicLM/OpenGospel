>8.12. Chapter 12</H1
><P
>1. IT is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.  I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.</P
><P
>2. I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.</P
><P
>3. And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)</P
><P
>4. How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.</P
><P
>5. Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.</P
><P
>6. For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.</P
><P
>7. And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</P
><P
>8. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</P
><P
>9. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.  Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</P
><P
>10. Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.</P
><P
>11. I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.</P
><P
>12. Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.</P
><P
>13. For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you?  forgive me this wrong.</P
><P
>14. Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not yours, but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</P
><P
>15. And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.</P
><P
>16. But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.</P
><P
>17. Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?</P
><P
>18. I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother.  Did Titus make a gain of you?  walked we not in the same spirit?  walked we not in the same steps?</P
><P
>19. Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you?  we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.</P
><P
>20. For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:</P
><P
>21. And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.</P
