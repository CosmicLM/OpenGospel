><P
>1. PAUL, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,</P
><P
>2. (Which he had promised afore by his prophets in the holy scriptures,)</P
><P
>3. Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;</P
><P
>4. And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:</P
><P
>5. By whom we have received grace and apostleship, for obedience to the faith among all nations, for his name:</P
><P
>6. Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:</P
><P
>7. To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</P
><P
>8. First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</P
><P
>9. For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;</P
><P
>10. Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you.</P
><P
>11. For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;</P
><P
>12. That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me.</P
><P
>13. Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles.</P
><P
>14. I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise.</P
><P
>15. So, as much as in me is, I am ready to preach the gospel to you that are at Rome also.</P
><P
>16. For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</P
><P
>17. For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.</P
><P
>18. For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness;</P
><P
>19. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them; for God hath shewed it unto them.</P
><P
>20. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</P
><P
>21. Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.</P
><P
>22. Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,</P
><P
>23. And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things.</P
><P
>24. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:</P
><P
>25. Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever.  Amen.</P
><P
>26. For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:</P
><P
>27. And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet.</P
><P
>28. And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;</P
><P
>29. Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,</P
><P
>30. Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</P
><P
>31. Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:</P
><P
>32. Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them.</P
