><P
>1. THE elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.</P
><P
>2. Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.</P
><P
>3. For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.</P
><P
>4. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.</P
><P
>5. Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren, and to strangers;</P
><P
>6. Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly sort, thou shalt do well:</P
><P
>7. Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.</P
><P
>8. We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpers to the truth.</P
><P
>9. I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.</P
><P
>10. Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church.</P
><P
>11. Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.  He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seen God.</P
><P
>12. Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.</P
><P
>13. I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen write unto thee:</P
><P
>14. But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face to face.  Peace be to thee.  Our friends salute thee.  Greet the friends by name.</P
