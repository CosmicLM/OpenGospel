>6.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. KNOW ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?</P
><P
>2. For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.</P
><P
>3. So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.</P
><P
>4. Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.</P
><P
>5. For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.</P
><P
>6. But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.</P
><P
>7. What shall we say then?  Is the law sin?  God forbid.  Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.</P
><P
>8. But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence.  For without the law sin was dead.</P
><P
>9. For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.</P
><P
>10. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.</P
><P
>11. For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</P
><P
>12. Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</P
><P
>13. Was then that which is good made death unto me?  God forbid.  But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.</P
><P
>14. For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</P
><P
>15. For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</P
><P
>16. If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.</P
><P
>17. Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</P
><P
>18. For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.</P
><P
>19. For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.</P
><P
>20. Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.</P
><P
>21. I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.</P
><P
>22. For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:</P
><P
>23. But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.</P
><P
>24. O wretched man that I am!  who shall deliver me from the body of this death?</P
><P
>25. I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.  So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.</P
