>7.11. Chapter 11</H1
><P
>1. BE ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.</P
><P
>2. Now I praise you, brethren, that ye remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you.</P
><P
>3. But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.</P
><P
>4. Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.</P
><P
>5. But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven.</P
><P
>6. For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.</P
><P
>7. For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man.</P
><P
>8. For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man.</P
><P
>9. Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.</P
><P
>10. For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.</P
><P
>11. Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.</P
><P
>12. For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God.</P
><P
>13. Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered?</P
><P
>14. Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?</P
><P
>15. But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering.</P
><P
>16. But if any man seem to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God.</P
><P
>17. Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse.</P
><P
>18. For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.</P
><P
>19. For there must be also heresies among you, that they which are approved may be made manifest among you.</P
><P
>20. When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper.</P
><P
>21. For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken.</P
><P
>22. What?  have ye not houses to eat and to drink in?  or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not?  What shall I say to you?  shall I praise you in this?  I praise you not.</P
><P
>23. For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:</P
><P
>24. And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.</P
><P
>25. After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me.</P
><P
>26. For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</P
><P
>27. Wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup of the Lord, unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.</P
><P
>28. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup.</P
><P
>29. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body.</P
><P
>30. For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.</P
><P
>31. For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.</P
><P
>32. But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world.</P
><P
>33. Wherefore, my brethren, when ye come together to eat, tarry one for another.</P
><P
>34. And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation.  And the rest will I set in order when I come.</P
