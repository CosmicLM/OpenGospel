>27.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. UNTO the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;</P
><P
>2. I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars:</P
><P
>3. And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast laboured, and hast not fainted.</P
><P
>4. Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love.</P
><P
>5. Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</P
><P
>6. But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</P
><P
>7. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.</P
><P
>8. And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;</P
><P
>9. I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.</P
><P
>10. Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</P
><P
>11. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death.</P
><P
>12. And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;</P
><P
>13. I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.</P
><P
>14. But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.</P
><P
>15. So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate.</P
><P
>16. Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth.</P
><P
>17. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.</P
><P
>18. And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;</P
><P
>19. I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the first.</P
><P
>20. Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.</P
><P
>21. And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she repented not.</P
><P
>22. Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent of their deeds.</P
><P
>23. And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.</P
><P
>24. But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.</P
><P
>25. But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.</P
><P
>26. And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations:</P
><P
>27. And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of my Father.</P
><P
>28. And I will give him the morning star.</P
><P
>29. He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches.</P
