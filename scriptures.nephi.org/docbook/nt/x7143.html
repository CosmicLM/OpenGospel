>16.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. THIS know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.</P
><P
>2. For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,</P
><P
>3. Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,</P
><P
>4. Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;</P
><P
>5. Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.</P
><P
>6. For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,</P
><P
>7. Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.</P
><P
>8. Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith.</P
><P
>9. But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was.</P
><P
>10. But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,</P
><P
>11. Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me.</P
><P
>12. Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution.</P
><P
>13. But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.</P
><P
>14. But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;</P
><P
>15. And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus.</P
><P
>16. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:</P
><P
>17. That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works.</P
