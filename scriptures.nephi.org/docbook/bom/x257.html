>1.11. Chapter 11</H1
><P
>1. For it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot.</P
><P
>2. And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?</P
><P
>3. And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.</P
><P
>4. And the Spirit said unto me: Believest thou that thy father saw the tree of which he hath spoken?</P
><P
>5. And I said: Yea, thou knowest that I believe all the words of my father.</P
><P
>6. And when I had spoken these words, the Spirit cried with a loud voice, saying: Hosanna to the Lord, the most high God; for he is God over all the earth, yea, even above all.  And blessed art thou, Nephi, because thou believest in the Son of the most high God; wherefore, thou shalt behold the things which thou hast desired.</P
><P
>7. And behold this thing shall be given unto thee for a sign, that after thou hast beheld the tree which bore the fruit which thy father tasted, thou shalt also behold a man descending out of heaven, and him shall ye witness; and after ye have witnessed him ye shall bear record that it is the Son of God.</P
><P
>8. And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look!  And I looked and beheld a tree; and it was like unto the tree which my father had seen; and the beauty thereof was far beyond, yea, exceeding of all beauty; and the whiteness thereof did exceed the whiteness of the driven snow.</P
><P
>9. And it came to pass after I had seen the tree, I said unto the Spirit: I behold thou hast shown unto me the tree which is precious above all.</P
><P
>10. And he said unto me: What desirest thou?</P
><P
>11. And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof--for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another.</P
><P
>12. And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look!  And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from before my presence.</P
><P
>13. And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities.  And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.</P
><P
>14. And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?</P
><P
>15. And I said unto him: A virgin, most beautiful and fair above all other virgins.</P
><P
>16. And he said unto me: Knowest thou the condescension of God?</P
><P
>17. And I said unto him: I know that he loveth his children; nevertheless, I do not know the meaning of all things.</P
><P
>18. And he said unto me: Behold, the virgin whom thou seest is the mother of the Son of God, after the manner of the flesh.</P
><P
>19. And it came to pass that I beheld that she was carried away in the Spirit; and after she had been carried away in the Spirit for the space of a time the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!</P
><P
>20. And I looked and beheld the virgin again, bearing a child in her arms.</P
><P
>21. And the angel said unto me: Behold the Lamb of God, yea, even the Son of the Eternal Father!  Knowest thou the meaning of the tree which thy father saw?</P
><P
>22. And I answered him, saying: Yea, it is the love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things.</P
><P
>23. And he spake unto me, saying: Yea, and the most joyous to the soul.</P
><P
>24. And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.</P
><P
>25. And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.</P
><P
>26. And the angel said unto me again: Look and behold the condescension of God!</P
><P
>27. And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should prepare the way before him.  And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.</P
><P
>28. And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them.</P
><P
>29. And I also beheld twelve others following him.  And it came to pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before my face, and I saw them not.</P
><P
>30. And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look!  And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them.</P
><P
>31. And he spake unto me again, saying: Look!  And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men.  And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me.  And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.</P
><P
>32. And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look!  And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.</P
><P
>33. And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.</P
><P
>34. And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord.</P
><P
>35. And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the building which my father saw.  And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</P
><P
>36. And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great.  And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</P
