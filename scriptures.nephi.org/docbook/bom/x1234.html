>2.23. Chapter 23</H1
><P
>1. The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.</P
><P
>2. Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.</P
><P
>3. I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones, for mine anger is not upon them that rejoice in my highness.</P
><P
>4. The noise of the multitude in the mountains like as of a great people, a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together, the Lord of Hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle.</P
><P
>5. They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, yea, the Lord, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</P
><P
>6. Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</P
><P
>7. Therefore shall all hands be faint, every man's heart shall melt;</P
><P
>8. And they shall be afraid; pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.</P
><P
>9. Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate; and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.</P
><P
>10. For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light; the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</P
><P
>11. And I will punish the world for evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay down the haughtiness of the terrible.</P
><P
>12. I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.</P
><P
>13. Therefore, I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of Hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.</P
><P
>14. And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up; and they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.</P
><P
>15. Every one that is proud shall be thrust through; yea, and every one that is joined to the wicked shall fall by the sword.</P
><P
>16. Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled and their wives ravished.</P
><P
>17. Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver and gold, nor shall they delight in it.</P
><P
>18. Their bows shall also dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall not spare children.</P
><P
>19. And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</P
><P
>20. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</P
><P
>21. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.</P
><P
>22. And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces; and her time is near to come, and her day shall not be prolonged.  For I will destroy her speedily; yea, for I will be merciful unto my people, but the wicked shall perish.</P
