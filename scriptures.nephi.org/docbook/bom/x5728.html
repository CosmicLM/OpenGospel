>11.14. Chapter 14</H1
><P
>1. And now it came to pass that when Jesus had spoken these words he turned again to the multitude, and did open his mouth unto them again, saying: Verily, verily, I say unto you, Judge not, that ye be not judged.</P
><P
>2. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</P
><P
>3. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?</P
><P
>4. Or how wilt thou say to thy brother: Let me pull the mote out of thine eye--and behold, a beam is in thine own eye?</P
><P
>5. Thou hypocrite, first cast the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast the mote out of thy brother's eye.</P
><P
>6. Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</P
><P
>7. Ask, and it shall be given unto you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</P
><P
>8. For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.</P
><P
>9. Or what man is there of you, who, if his son ask bread, will give him a stone?</P
><P
>10. Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?</P
><P
>11. If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to them that ask him?</P
><P
>12. Therefore, all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them, for this is the law and the prophets.</P
><P
>13. Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, which leadeth to destruction, and many there be who go in thereat;</P
><P
>14. Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</P
><P
>15. Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</P
><P
>16. Ye shall know them by their fruits.  Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</P
><P
>17. Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</P
><P
>18. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.</P
><P
>19. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.</P
><P
>20. Wherefore, by their fruits ye shall know them.</P
><P
>21. Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.</P
><P
>22. Many will say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name, and in thy name have cast out devils, and in thy name done many wonderful works?</P
><P
>23. And then will I profess unto them: I never knew you; depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</P
><P
>24. Therefore, whoso heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, who built his house upon a rock--</P
><P
>25. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock.</P
><P
>26. And every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man, who built his house upon the sand--</P
><P
>27. And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the fall of it.</P
