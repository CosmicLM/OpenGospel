><P
>1. AND after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them: and David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</P
><P
>2. And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive.  And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.</P
><P
>3. ¶ David smote also Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</P
><P
>4. And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven hundred horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: and David houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them for an hundred chariots.</P
><P
>5. And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand men.</P
><P
>6. Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts.  And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</P
><P
>7. And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.</P
><P
>8. And from Betah, and from Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, king David took exceeding much brass.</P
><P
>9. ¶ When Toi king of Hamath heard that David had smitten all the host of Hadadezer,</P
><P
>10. Then Toi sent Joram his son unto king David, to salute him, and to bless him, because he had fought against Hadadezer, and smitten him: for Hadadezer had wars with Toi.  And Joram brought with him vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and vessels of brass:</P
><P
>11. Which also king David did dedicate unto the LORD, with the silver and gold that he had dedicated of all nations which he subdued;</P
><P
>12. Of Syria, and of Moab, and of the children of Ammon, and of the Philistines, and of Amalek, and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob, king of Zobah.</P
><P
>13. And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt, being eighteen thousand men.</P
><P
>14. ¶ And he put garrisons in Edom; throughout all Edom put he garrisons, and all they of Edom became David's servants.  And the LORD preserved David whithersoever he went.</P
><P
>15. And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice unto all his people.</P
><P
>16. And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder;</P
><P
>17. And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, were the priests; and Seraiah was the scribe;</P
><P
>18. And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.</P
