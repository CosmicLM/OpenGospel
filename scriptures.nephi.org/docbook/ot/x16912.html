>19.107. Chapter 107</H1
><P
>1. O GIVE thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</P
><P
>2. Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy;</P
><P
>3. And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south.</P
><P
>4. They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in.</P
><P
>5. Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.</P
><P
>6. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses.</P
><P
>7. And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation.</P
><P
>8. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</P
><P
>9. For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.</P
><P
>10. Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction and iron;</P
><P
>11. Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High:</P
><P
>12. Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.</P
><P
>13. Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses.</P
><P
>14. He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and brake their bands in sunder.</P
><P
>15. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</P
><P
>16. For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.</P
><P
>17. Fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted.</P
><P
>18. Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death.</P
><P
>19. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses.</P
><P
>20. He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from their destructions.</P
><P
>21. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</P
><P
>22. And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.</P
><P
>23. They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters;</P
><P
>24. These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.</P
><P
>25. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof.</P
><P
>26. They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths: their soul is melted because of trouble.</P
><P
>27. They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wits' end.</P
><P
>28. Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses.</P
><P
>29. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still.</P
><P
>30. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven.</P
><P
>31. Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!</P
><P
>32. Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and praise him in the assembly of the elders.</P
><P
>33. He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into dry ground;</P
><P
>34. A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.</P
><P
>35. He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry ground into watersprings.</P
><P
>36. And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation;</P
><P
>37. And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase.</P
><P
>38. He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.</P
><P
>39. Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow.</P
><P
>40. He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander in the wilderness, where there is no way.</P
><P
>41. Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock.</P
><P
>42. The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shall stop her mouth.</P
><P
>43. Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.</P
