>9.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. AND the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no open vision.</P
><P
>2. And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see;</P
><P
>3. And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;</P
><P
>4. That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.</P
><P
>5. And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst me.  And he said, I called not; lie down again.  And he went and lay down.</P
><P
>6. And the LORD called yet again, Samuel.  And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.  And he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.</P
><P
>7. Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of the LORD yet revealed unto him.</P
><P
>8. And the LORD called Samuel again the third time.  And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.  And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.</P
><P
>9. Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be, if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy servant heareth.  So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</P
><P
>10. And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.  Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant heareth.</P
><P
>11. ¶ And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it shall tingle.</P
><P
>12. In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an end.</P
><P
>13. For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</P
><P
>14. And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor offering for ever.</P
><P
>15. ¶ And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the LORD.  And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.</P
><P
>16. Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son.  And he answered, Here am I.</P
><P
>17. And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto thee?  I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things that he said unto thee.</P
><P
>18. And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.</P
><P
>19. ¶ And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none of his words fall to the ground.</P
><P
>20. And all Israel from Dan even to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the LORD.</P
><P
>21. And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</P
