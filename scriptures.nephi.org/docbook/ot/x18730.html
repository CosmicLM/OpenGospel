>21.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. TO every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</P
><P
>2. A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up that which is planted;</P
><P
>3. A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</P
><P
>4. A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;</P
><P
>5. A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;</P
><P
>6. A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time to cast away;</P
><P
>7. A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and a time to speak;</P
><P
>8. A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time of peace.</P
><P
>9. What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?</P
><P
>10. I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of men to be exercised in it.</P
><P
>11. He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.</P
><P
>12. I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to rejoice, and to do good in his life.</P
><P
>13. And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.</P
><P
>14. I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doeth it, that men should fear before him.</P
><P
>15. That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past.</P
><P
>16. ¶ And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that iniquity was there.</P
><P
>17. I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for every work.</P
><P
>18. I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men, that God might manifest them, and that they might see that they themselves are beasts.</P
><P
>19. For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts; even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.</P
><P
>20. All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to dust again.</P
><P
>21. Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?</P
><P
>22. Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion: for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?</P
