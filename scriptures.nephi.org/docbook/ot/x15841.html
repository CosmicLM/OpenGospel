>19.55. Chapter 55</H1
><P
>1. GIVE ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.</P
><P
>2. Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make a noise;</P
><P
>3. Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.</P
><P
>4. My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death are fallen upon me.</P
><P
>5. Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.</P
><P
>6. And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove!  for then would I fly away, and be at rest.</P
><P
>7. Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.  Selah.</P
><P
>8. I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.</P
><P
>9. Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen violence and strife in the city.</P
><P
>10. Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.</P
><P
>11. Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart not from her streets.</P
><P
>12. For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:</P
><P
>13. But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.</P
><P
>14. We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.</P
><P
>15. Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.</P
><P
>16. As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.</P
><P
>17. Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.</P
><P
>18. He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me: for there were many with me.</P
><P
>19. God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.  Selah.  Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.</P
><P
>20. He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him: he hath broken his covenant.</P
><P
>21. The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.</P
><P
>22. Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.</P
><P
>23. But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee.</P
