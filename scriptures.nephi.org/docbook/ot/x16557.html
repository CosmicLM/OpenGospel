>19.90. Chapter 90</H1
><P
>1. LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.</P
><P
>2. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God.</P
><P
>3. Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.</P
><P
>4. For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night.</P
><P
>5. Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.</P
><P
>6. In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth.</P
><P
>7. For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled.</P
><P
>8. Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</P
><P
>9. For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our years as a tale that is told.</P
><P
>10. The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.</P
><P
>11. Who knoweth the power of thine anger?  even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath.</P
><P
>12. So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom.</P
><P
>13. Return, O LORD, how long?  and let it repent thee concerning thy servants.</P
><P
>14. O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be glad all our days.</P
><P
>15. Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.</P
><P
>16. Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto their children.</P
><P
>17. And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</P
