>19.109. Chapter 109</H1
><P
>1. HOLD not thy peace, O God of my praise;</P
><P
>2. For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.</P
><P
>3. They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.</P
><P
>4. For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto prayer.</P
><P
>5. And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.</P
><P
>6. Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his right hand.</P
><P
>7. When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his prayer become sin.</P
><P
>8. Let his days be few; and let another take his office.</P
><P
>9. Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.</P
><P
>10. Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them seek their bread also out of their desolate places.</P
><P
>11. Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.</P
><P
>12. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there be any to favour his fatherless children.</P
><P
>13. Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.</P
><P
>14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.</P
><P
>15. Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.</P
><P
>16. Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.</P
><P
>17. As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him.</P
><P
>18. As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.</P
><P
>19. Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.</P
><P
>20. Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.</P
><P
>21. But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake: because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.</P
><P
>22. For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.</P
><P
>23. I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up and down as the locust.</P
><P
>24. My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.</P
><P
>25. I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me they shaked their heads.</P
><P
>26. Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:</P
><P
>27. That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.</P
><P
>28. Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.</P
><P
>29. Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.</P
><P
>30. I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.</P
><P
>31. For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.</P
