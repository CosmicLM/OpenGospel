>22.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. WHITHER is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women? whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with thee.</P
><P
>2. My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.</P
><P
>3. I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies.</P
><P
>4. ¶ Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners.</P
><P
>5. Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.</P
><P
>6. Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them.</P
><P
>7. As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.</P
><P
>8. There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number.</P
><P
>9. My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</P
><P
>10. ¶ Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?</P
><P
>11. I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.</P
><P
>12. Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.</P
><P
>13. Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.</P
