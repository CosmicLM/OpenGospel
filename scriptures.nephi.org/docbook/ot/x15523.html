>19.37. Chapter 37</H1
><P
>1. FRET not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity.</P
><P
>2. For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb.</P
><P
>3. Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed.</P
><P
>4. Delight thyself also in the LORD; and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart.</P
><P
>5. Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass.</P
><P
>6. And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday.</P
><P
>7. Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass.</P
><P
>8. Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wise to do evil.</P
><P
>9. For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the LORD, they shall inherit the earth.</P
><P
>10. For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.</P
><P
>11. But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.</P
><P
>12. The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth.</P
><P
>13. The Lord shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is coming.</P
><P
>14. The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of upright conversation.</P
><P
>15. Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken.</P
><P
>16. A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked.</P
><P
>17. For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD upholdeth the righteous.</P
><P
>18. The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritance shall be for ever.</P
><P
>19. They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied.</P
><P
>20. But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.</P
><P
>21. The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous sheweth mercy, and giveth.</P
><P
>22. For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.</P
><P
>23. The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he delighteth in his way.</P
><P
>24. Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORD upholdeth him with his hand.</P
><P
>25. I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.</P
><P
>26. He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.</P
><P
>27. Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.</P
><P
>28. For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.</P
><P
>29. The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for ever.</P
><P
>30. The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue talketh of judgment.</P
><P
>31. The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall slide.</P
><P
>32. The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.</P
><P
>33. The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when he is judged.</P
><P
>34. Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.</P
><P
>35. I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself like a green bay tree.</P
><P
>36. Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, but he could not be found.</P
><P
>37. Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of that man is peace.</P
><P
>38. But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of the wicked shall be cut off.</P
><P
>39. But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their strength in the time of trouble.</P
><P
>40. And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.</P
