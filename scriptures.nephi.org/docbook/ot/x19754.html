>23.33. Chapter 33</H1
><P
>1. WOE to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with thee!  when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled; and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee.</P
><P
>2. O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of trouble.</P
><P
>3. At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up of thyself the nations were scattered.</P
><P
>4. And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run upon them.</P
><P
>5. The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteousness.</P
><P
>6. And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times, and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his treasure.</P
><P
>7. Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors of peace shall weep bitterly.</P
><P
>8. The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth no man.</P
><P
>9. The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness: and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.</P
><P
>10. Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now will I lift up myself.</P
><P
>11. Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your breath, as fire, shall devour you.</P
><P
>12. And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire.</P
><P
>13. ¶ Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are near, acknowledge my might.</P
><P
>14. The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the hypocrites.  Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?  who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?</P
><P
>15. He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;</P
><P
>16. He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall be sure.</P
><P
>17. Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold the land that is very far off.</P
><P
>18. Thine heart shall meditate terror.  Where is the scribe?  where is the receiver?  where is he that counted the towers?</P
><P
>19. Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that thou canst not understand.</P
><P
>20. Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.</P
><P
>21. But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars, neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.</P
><P
>22. For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD is our king; he will save us.</P
><P
>23. Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.</P
><P
>24. And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.</P
