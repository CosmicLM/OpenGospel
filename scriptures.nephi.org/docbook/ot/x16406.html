><P
>1. KEEP not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not still, O God.</P
><P
>2. For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.</P
><P
>3. They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones.</P
><P
>4. They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.</P
><P
>5. For they have consulted together with one consent: they are confederate against thee:</P
><P
>6. The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes;</P
><P
>7. Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;</P
><P
>8. Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children of Lot.  Selah.</P
><P
>9. Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison:</P
><P
>10. Which perished at En-dor: they became as dung for the earth.</P
><P
>11. Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:</P
><P
>12. Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession.</P
><P
>13. O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind.</P
><P
>14. As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire;</P
><P
>15. So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm.</P
><P
>16. Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O LORD.</P
><P
>17. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish:</P
><P
>18. That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the most high over all the earth.</P
