>19.59. Chapter 59</H1
><P
>1. DELIVER me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them that rise up against me.</P
><P
>2. Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.</P
><P
>3. For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.</P
><P
>4. They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to help me, and behold.</P
><P
>5. Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.  Selah.</P
><P
>6. They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</P
><P
>7. Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their lips: for who, say they, doth hear?</P
><P
>8. But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.</P
><P
>9. Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my defence.</P
><P
>10. The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies.</P
><P
>11. Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</P
><P
>12. For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which they speak.</P
><P
>13. Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth.  Selah.</P
><P
>14. And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.</P
><P
>15. Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.</P
><P
>16. But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble.</P
><P
>17. Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy.</P
