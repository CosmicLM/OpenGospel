>18.22. Chapter 22</H1
><P
>1. THEN Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</P
><P
>2. Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself?</P
><P
>3. Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?  or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?</P
><P
>4. Will he reprove thee for fear of thee?  will he enter with thee into judgment?</P
><P
>5. Is not thy wickedness great?  and thine iniquities infinite?</P
><P
>6. For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.</P
><P
>7. Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast withholden bread from the hungry.</P
><P
>8. But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourable man dwelt in it.</P
><P
>9. Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless have been broken.</P
><P
>10. Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleth thee;</P
><P
>11. Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters cover thee.</P
><P
>12. Is not God in the height of heaven?  and behold the height of the stars, how high they are!</P
><P
>13. And thou sayest, How doth God know?  can he judge through the dark cloud?</P
><P
>14. Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit of heaven.</P
><P
>15. Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?</P
><P
>16. Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflown with a flood:</P
><P
>17. Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty do for them?</P
><P
>18. Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</P
><P
>19. The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh them to scorn.</P
><P
>20. Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them the fire consumeth.</P
><P
>21. Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good shall come unto thee.</P
><P
>22. Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his words in thine heart.</P
><P
>23. If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.</P
><P
>24. Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones of the brooks.</P
><P
>25. Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have plenty of silver.</P
><P
>26. For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shalt lift up thy face unto God.</P
><P
>27. Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, and thou shalt pay thy vows.</P
><P
>28. Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.</P
><P
>29. When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting up; and he shall save the humble person.</P
><P
>30. He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is delivered by the pureness of thine hands.</P
