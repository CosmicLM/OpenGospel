>18.30. Chapter 30</H1
><P
>1. BUT now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.</P
><P
>2. Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whom old age was perished?</P
><P
>3. For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.</P
><P
>4. Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their meat.</P
><P
>5. They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them as after a thief;)</P
><P
>6. To dwell in the clifts of the valleys, in caves of the earth, and in the rocks.</P
><P
>7. Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were gathered together.</P
><P
>8. They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they were viler than the earth.</P
><P
>9. And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.</P
><P
>10. They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in my face.</P
><P
>11. Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have also let loose the bridle before me.</P
><P
>12. Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.</P
><P
>13. They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no helper.</P
><P
>14. They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the desolation they rolled themselves upon me.</P
><P
>15. Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.</P
><P
>16. And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction have taken hold upon me.</P
><P
>17. My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews take no rest.</P
><P
>18. By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.</P
><P
>19. He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and ashes.</P
><P
>20. I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thou regardest me not.</P
><P
>21. Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposest thyself against me.</P
><P
>22. Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it, and dissolvest my substance.</P
><P
>23. For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house appointed for all living.</P
><P
>24. Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though they cry in his destruction.</P
><P
>25. Did not I weep for him that was in trouble?  was not my soul grieved for the poor?</P
><P
>26. When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.</P
><P
>27. My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction prevented me.</P
><P
>28. I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in the congregation.</P
><P
>29. I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.</P
><P
>30. My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.</P
><P
>31. My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voice of them that weep.</P
