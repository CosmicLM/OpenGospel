><P
>1. AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</P
><P
>2. Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation for her infirmity shall she be unclean.</P
><P
>3. And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.</P
><P
>4. And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be fulfilled.</P
><P
>5. But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the blood of her purifying threescore and six days.</P
><P
>6. And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, unto the priest:</P
><P
>7. Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.  This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.</P
><P
>8. And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.</P
