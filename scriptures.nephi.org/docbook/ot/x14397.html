>18.24. Chapter 24</H1
><P
>1. WHY, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they that know him not see his days?</P
><P
>2. Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.</P
><P
>3. They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow's ox for a pledge.</P
><P
>4. They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide themselves together.</P
><P
>5. Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them and for their children.</P
><P
>6. They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the vintage of the wicked.</P
><P
>7. They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have no covering in the cold.</P
><P
>8. They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace the rock for want of a shelter.</P
><P
>9. They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge of the poor.</P
><P
>10. They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take away the sheaf from the hungry;</P
><P
>11. Which make oil within their walls, and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.</P
><P
>12. Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.</P
><P
>13. They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.</P
><P
>14. The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy, and in the night is as a thief.</P
><P
>15. The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.</P
><P
>16. In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.</P
><P
>17. For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.</P
><P
>18. He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.</P
><P
>19. Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave those which have sinned.</P
><P
>20. The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him; he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as a tree.</P
><P
>21. He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not good to the widow.</P
><P
>22. He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and no man is sure of life.</P
><P
>23. Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yet his eyes are upon their ways.</P
><P
>24. They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as the tops of the ears of corn.</P
><P
>25. And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my speech nothing worth?</P
