>25.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. HOW is the gold become dim!  how is the most fine gold changed!  the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.</P
><P
>2. The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!</P
><P
>3. Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones: the daughter of my people is become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness.</P
><P
>4. The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the young children ask bread, and no man breaketh it unto them.</P
><P
>5. They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets: they that were brought up in scarlet embrace dunghills.</P
><P
>6. For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.</P
><P
>7. Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire:</P
><P
>8. Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets: their skin cleaveth to their bones; it is withered, it is become like a stick.</P
><P
>9. They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger: for these pine away, stricken through for want of the fruits of the field.</P
><P
>10. The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people.</P
><P
>11. The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.</P
><P
>12. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.</P
><P
>13. ¶ For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,</P
><P
>14. They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.</P
><P
>15. They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not: when they fled away and wandered, they said among the heathen, They shall no more sojourn there.</P
><P
>16. The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them: they respected not the persons of the priests, they favoured not the elders.</P
><P
>17. As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help: in our watching we have watched for a nation that could not save us.</P
><P
>18. They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets: our end is near, our days are fulfilled; for our end is come.</P
><P
>19. Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven: they pursued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderness.</P
><P
>20. The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.</P
><P
>21. ¶ Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee: thou shalt be drunken, and shalt make thyself naked.</P
><P
>22. ¶ The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity: he will visit thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom; he will discover thy sins.</P
