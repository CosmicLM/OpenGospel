>18.5. Chapter 5</H1
><P
>1. CALL now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which of the saints wilt thou turn?</P
><P
>2. For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly one.</P
><P
>3. I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his habitation.</P
><P
>4. His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the gate, neither is there any to deliver them.</P
><P
>5. Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.</P
><P
>6. Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</P
><P
>7. Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.</P
><P
>8. I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:</P
><P
>9. Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things without number:</P
><P
>10. Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the fields:</P
><P
>11. To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn may be exalted to safety.</P
><P
>12. He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</P
><P
>13. He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of the froward is carried headlong.</P
><P
>14. They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope in the noonday as in the night.</P
><P
>15. But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty.</P
><P
>16. So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</P
><P
>17. Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:</P
><P
>18. For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.</P
><P
>19. He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</P
><P
>20. In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the power of the sword.</P
><P
>21. Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</P
><P
>22. At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</P
><P
>23. For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</P
><P
>24. And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.</P
><P
>25. Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</P
><P
>26. Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.</P
><P
>27. Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</P
