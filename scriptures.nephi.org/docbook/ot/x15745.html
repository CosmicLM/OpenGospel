>19.49. Chapter 49</H1
><P
>1. HEAR this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the world:</P
><P
>2. Both low and high, rich and poor, together.</P
><P
>3. My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart shall be of understanding.</P
><P
>4. I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark saying upon the harp.</P
><P
>5. Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?</P
><P
>6. They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches;</P
><P
>7. None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ransom for him:</P
><P
>8. (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever:)</P
><P
>9. That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.</P
><P
>10. For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.</P
><P
>11. Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names.</P
><P
>12. Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the beasts that perish.</P
><P
>13. This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve their sayings.  Selah.</P
><P
>14. Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.</P
><P
>15. But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for he shall receive me.  Selah.</P
><P
>16. Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased;</P
><P
>17. For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.</P
><P
>18. Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself.</P
><P
>19. He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light.</P
><P
>20. Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beasts that perish.</P
