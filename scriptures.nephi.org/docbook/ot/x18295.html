>20.20. Chapter 20</H1
><P
>1. WINE is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is deceived thereby is not wise.</P
><P
>2. The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.</P
><P
>3. It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool will be meddling.</P
><P
>4. The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.</P
><P
>5. Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out.</P
><P
>6. Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a faithful man who can find?</P
><P
>7. The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are blessed after him.</P
><P
>8. A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away all evil with his eyes.</P
><P
>9. Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</P
><P
>10. Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike abomination to the LORD.</P
><P
>11. Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure, and whether it be right.</P
><P
>12. The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even both of them.</P
><P
>13. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes, and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.</P
><P
>14. It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is gone his way, then he boasteth.</P
><P
>15. There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel.</P
><P
>16. Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</P
><P
>17. Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.</P
><P
>18. Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice make war.</P
><P
>19. He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets: therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.</P
><P
>20. Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put out in obscure darkness.</P
><P
>21. An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the end thereof shall not be blessed.</P
><P
>22. Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD, and he shall save thee.</P
><P
>23. Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false balance is not good.</P
><P
>24. Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand his own way?</P
><P
>25. It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry.</P
><P
>26. A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over them.</P
><P
>27. The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the inward parts of the belly.</P
><P
>28. Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden by mercy.</P
><P
>29. The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of old men is the gray head.</P
><P
>30. The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the inward parts of the belly.</P
