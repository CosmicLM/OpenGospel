>20.11. Chapter 11</H1
><P
>1. A FALSE balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight is his delight.</P
><P
>2. When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom.</P
><P
>3. The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.</P
><P
>4. Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivereth from death.</P
><P
>5. The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.</P
><P
>6. The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.</P
><P
>7. When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth.</P
><P
>8. The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.</P
><P
>9. An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but through knowledge shall the just be delivered.</P
><P
>10. When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and when the wicked perish, there is shouting.</P
><P
>11. By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.</P
><P
>12. He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.</P
><P
>13. A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit concealeth the matter.</P
><P
>14. Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.</P
><P
>15. He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he that hateth suretiship is sure.</P
><P
>16. A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.</P
><P
>17. The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is cruel troubleth his own flesh.</P
><P
>18. The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth righteousness shall be a sure reward.</P
><P
>19. As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death.</P
><P
>20. They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD: but such as are upright in their way are his delight.</P
><P
>21. Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished: but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.</P
><P
>22. As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.</P
><P
>23. The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation of the wicked is wrath.</P
><P
>24. There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.</P
><P
>25. The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall be watered also himself.</P
><P
>26. He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.</P
><P
>27. He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.</P
><P
>28. He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.</P
><P
>29. He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.</P
><P
>30. The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.</P
><P
>31. Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much more the wicked and the sinner.</P
