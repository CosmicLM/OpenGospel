>19.81. Chapter 81</H1
><P
>1. SING aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the God of Jacob.</P
><P
>2. Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.</P
><P
>3. Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.</P
><P
>4. For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.</P
><P
>5. This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understood not.</P
><P
>6. I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were delivered from the pots.</P
><P
>7. Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.  Selah.</P
><P
>8. Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if thou wilt hearken unto me;</P
><P
>9. There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.</P
><P
>10. I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.</P
><P
>11. But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.</P
><P
>12. So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked in their own counsels.</P
><P
>13. Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!</P
><P
>14. I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.</P
><P
>15. The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him: but their time should have endured for ever.</P
><P
>16. He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.</P
