>18.12. Chapter 12</H1
><P
>1. AND Job answered and said,</P
><P
>2. No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.</P
><P
>3. But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?</P
><P
>4. I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.</P
><P
>5. He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease.</P
><P
>6. The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.</P
><P
>7. But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:</P
><P
>8. Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare unto thee.</P
><P
>9. Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath wrought this?</P
><P
>10. In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</P
><P
>11. Doth not the ear try words?  and the mouth taste his meat?</P
><P
>12. With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.</P
><P
>13. With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding.</P
><P
>14. Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.</P
><P
>15. Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.</P
><P
>16. With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver are his.</P
><P
>17. He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges fools.</P
><P
>18. He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle.</P
><P
>19. He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.</P
><P
>20. He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the understanding of the aged.</P
><P
>21. He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength of the mighty.</P
><P
>22. He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out to light the shadow of death.</P
><P
>23. He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth the nations, and straiteneth them again.</P
><P
>24. He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is no way.</P
><P
>25. They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to stagger like a drunken man.</P
