>19.73. Chapter 73</H1
><P
>1. TRULY God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart.</P
><P
>2. But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped.</P
><P
>3. For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.</P
><P
>4. For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is firm.</P
><P
>5. They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men.</P
><P
>6. Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.</P
><P
>7. Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart could wish.</P
><P
>8. They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: they speak loftily.</P
><P
>9. They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth.</P
><P
>10. Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them.</P
><P
>11. And they say, How doth God know?  and is there knowledge in the most High?</P
><P
>12. Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches.</P
><P
>13. Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency.</P
><P
>14. For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning.</P
><P
>15. If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children.</P
><P
>16. When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;</P
><P
>17. Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.</P
><P
>18. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst them down into destruction.</P
><P
>19. How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment!  they are utterly consumed with terrors.</P
><P
>20. As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.</P
><P
>21. Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.</P
><P
>22. So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.</P
><P
>23. Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me by my right hand.</P
><P
>24. Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me to glory.</P
><P
>25. Whom have I in heaven but thee?  and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee.</P
><P
>26. My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever.</P
><P
>27. For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.</P
><P
>28. But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.</P
