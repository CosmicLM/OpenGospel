>18.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. IS there not an appointed time to man upon earth?  are not his days also like the days of an hireling?</P
><P
>2. As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for the reward of his work:</P
><P
>3. So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights are appointed to me.</P
><P
>4. When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?  and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.</P
><P
>5. My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is broken, and become loathsome.</P
><P
>6. My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent without hope.</P
><P
>7. O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.</P
><P
>8. The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyes are upon me, and I am not.</P
><P
>9. As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth down to the grave shall come up no more.</P
><P
>10. He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place know him any more.</P
><P
>11. Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.</P
><P
>12. Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?</P
><P
>13. When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint;</P
><P
>14. Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions:</P
><P
>15. So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my life.</P
><P
>16. I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days are vanity.</P
><P
>17. What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him?  and that thou shouldest set thine heart upon him?</P
><P
>18. And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him every moment?</P
><P
>19. How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down my spittle?</P
><P
>20. I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am a burden to myself?</P
><P
>21. And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away mine iniquity?  for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.</P
