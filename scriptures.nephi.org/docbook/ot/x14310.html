>18.21. Chapter 21</H1
><P
>1. BUT Job answered and said,</P
><P
>2. Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.</P
><P
>3. Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock on.</P
><P
>4. As for me, is my complaint to man?  and if it were so, why should not my spirit be troubled?</P
><P
>5. Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.</P
><P
>6. Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on my flesh.</P
><P
>7. Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in power?</P
><P
>8. Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes.</P
><P
>9. Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God upon them.</P
><P
>10. Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and casteth not her calf.</P
><P
>11. They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their children dance.</P
><P
>12. They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ.</P
><P
>13. They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave.</P
><P
>14. Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of thy ways.</P
><P
>15. What is the Almighty, that we should serve him?  and what profit should we have, if we pray unto him?</P
><P
>16. Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.</P
><P
>17. How oft is the candle of the wicked put out!  and how oft cometh their destruction upon them!  God distributeth sorrows in his anger.</P
><P
>18. They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the storm carrieth away.</P
><P
>19. God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him, and he shall know it.</P
><P
>20. His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the wrath of the Almighty.</P
><P
>21. For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the number of his months is cut off in the midst?</P
><P
>22. Shall any teach God knowledge?  seeing he judgeth those that are high.</P
><P
>23. One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.</P
><P
>24. His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with marrow.</P
><P
>25. And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never eateth with pleasure.</P
><P
>26. They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall cover them.</P
><P
>27. Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye wrongfully imagine against me.</P
><P
>28. For ye say, Where is the house of the prince?  and where are the dwelling places of the wicked?</P
><P
>29. Have ye not asked them that go by the way?  and do ye not know their tokens,</P
><P
>30. That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction?  they shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.</P
><P
>31. Who shall declare his way to his face?  and who shall repay him what he hath done?</P
><P
>32. Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the tomb.</P
><P
>33. The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.</P
><P
>34. How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there remaineth falsehood?</P
