>22.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. HOW beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter! the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a cunning workman.</P
><P
>2. Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</P
><P
>3. Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</P
><P
>4. Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</P
><P
>5. Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.</P
><P
>6. How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!</P
><P
>7. This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.</P
><P
>8. I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;</P
><P
>9. And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</P
><P
>10. ¶ I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.</P
><P
>11. Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</P
><P
>12. Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.</P
><P
>13. The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</P
