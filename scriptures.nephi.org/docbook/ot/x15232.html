><P
>1. THE king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!</P
><P
>2. Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips.  Selah.</P
><P
>3. For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou settest a crown of pure gold on his head.</P
><P
>4. He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.</P
><P
>5. His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thou laid upon him.</P
><P
>6. For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made him exceeding glad with thy countenance.</P
><P
>7. For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.</P
><P
>8. Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee.</P
><P
>9. Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them.</P
><P
>10. Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.</P
><P
>11. For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.</P
><P
>12. Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.</P
><P
>13. Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing and praise thy power.</P
