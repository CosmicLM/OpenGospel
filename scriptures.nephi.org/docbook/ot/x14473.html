>18.28. Chapter 28</H1
><P
>1. SURELY there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold where they fine it.</P
><P
>2. Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone.</P
><P
>3. He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.</P
><P
>4. The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.</P
><P
>5. As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turned up as it were fire.</P
><P
>6. The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust of gold.</P
><P
>7. There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's eye hath not seen:</P
><P
>8. The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion passed by it.</P
><P
>9. He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the mountains by the roots.</P
><P
>10. He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every precious thing.</P
><P
>11. He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is hid bringeth he forth to light.</P
><P
>12. But where shall wisdom be found?  and where is the place of understanding?</P
><P
>13. Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the land of the living.</P
><P
>14. The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not with me.</P
><P
>15. It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed for the price thereof.</P
><P
>16. It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious onyx, or the sapphire.</P
><P
>17. The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.</P
><P
>18. No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price of wisdom is above rubies.</P
><P
>19. The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be valued with pure gold.</P
><P
>20. Whence then cometh wisdom?  and where is the place of understanding?</P
><P
>21. Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close from the fowls of the air.</P
><P
>22. Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with our ears.</P
><P
>23. God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</P
><P
>24. For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven;</P
><P
>25. To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters by measure.</P
><P
>26. When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightning of the thunder:</P
><P
>27. Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and searched it out.</P
><P
>28. And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.</P
