><P
>1. BLESS the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless his holy name.</P
><P
>2. Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:</P
><P
>3. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases;</P
><P
>4. Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</P
><P
>5. Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's.</P
><P
>6. The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.</P
><P
>7. He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.</P
><P
>8. The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.</P
><P
>9. He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.</P
><P
>10. He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.</P
><P
>11. For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.</P
><P
>12. As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</P
><P
>13. Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.</P
><P
>14. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.</P
><P
>15. As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</P
><P
>16. For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more.</P
><P
>17. But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's children;</P
><P
>18. To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</P
><P
>19. The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his kingdom ruleth over all.</P
><P
>20. Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.</P
><P
>21. Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that do his pleasure.</P
><P
>22. Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion: bless the LORD, O my soul.</P
