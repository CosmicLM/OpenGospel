>18.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. THEN Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,</P
><P
>2. If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved?  but who can withhold himself from speaking?</P
><P
>3. Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</P
><P
>4. Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast strengthened the feeble knees.</P
><P
>5. But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</P
><P
>6. Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the uprightness of thy ways?</P
><P
>7. Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent?  or where were the righteous cut off?</P
><P
>8. Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.</P
><P
>9. By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrils are they consumed.</P
><P
>10. The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</P
><P
>11. The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's whelps are scattered abroad.</P
><P
>12. Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received a little thereof.</P
><P
>13. In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth on men,</P
><P
>14. Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to shake.</P
><P
>15. Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stood up:</P
><P
>16. It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice, saying,</P
><P
>17. Shall mortal man be more just than God?  shall a man be more pure than his maker?</P
><P
>18. Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he charged with folly:</P
><P
>19. How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?</P
><P
>20. They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.</P
><P
>21. Doth not their excellency which is in them go away?  they die, even without wisdom.</P
