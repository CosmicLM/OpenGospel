>18.10. Chapter 10</H1
><P
>1. MY soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.</P
><P
>2. I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou contendest with me.</P
><P
>3. Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked?</P
><P
>4. Hast thou eyes of flesh?  or seest thou as man seeth?</P
><P
>5. Are thy days as the days of man?  are thy years as man's days,</P
><P
>6. That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?</P
><P
>7. Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can deliver out of thine hand.</P
><P
>8. Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about; yet thou dost destroy me.</P
><P
>9. Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; and wilt thou bring me into dust again?</P
><P
>10. Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like cheese?</P
><P
>11. Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.</P
><P
>12. Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath preserved my spirit.</P
><P
>13. And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that this is with thee.</P
><P
>14. If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me from mine iniquity.</P
><P
>15. If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head.  I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mine affliction;</P
><P
>16. For it increaseth.  Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.</P
><P
>17. Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.</P
><P
>18. Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb?  Oh that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!</P
><P
>19. I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave.</P
><P
>20. Are not my days few?  cease then, and let me alone, that I may take comfort a little,</P
><P
>21. Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death;</P
><P
>22. A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.</P
