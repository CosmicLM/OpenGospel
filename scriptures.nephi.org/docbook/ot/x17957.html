>20.9. Chapter 9</H1
><P
>1. WISDOM hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:</P
><P
>2. She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.</P
><P
>3. She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,</P
><P
>4. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</P
><P
>5. Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</P
><P
>6. Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.</P
><P
>7. He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.</P
><P
>8. Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.</P
><P
>9. Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.</P
><P
>10. The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.</P
><P
>11. For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.</P
><P
>12. If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.</P
><P
>13. ¶ A foolish woman is clamourous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.</P
><P
>14. For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,</P
><P
>15. To call passengers who go right on their ways:</P
><P
>16. Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,</P
><P
>17. Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.</P
><P
>18. But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.</P
