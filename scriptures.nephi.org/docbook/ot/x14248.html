>18.19. Chapter 19</H1
><P
>1. THEN Job answered and said,</P
><P
>2. How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with words?</P
><P
>3. These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange to me.</P
><P
>4. And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with myself.</P
><P
>5. If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead against me my reproach:</P
><P
>6. Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me with his net.</P
><P
>7. Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.</P
><P
>8. He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set darkness in my paths.</P
><P
>9. He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my head.</P
><P
>10. He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hope hath he removed like a tree.</P
><P
>11. He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me unto him as one of his enemies.</P
><P
>12. His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, and encamp round about my tabernacle.</P
><P
>13. He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily estranged from me.</P
><P
>14. My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgotten me.</P
><P
>15. They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a stranger: I am an alien in their sight.</P
><P
>16. I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him with my mouth.</P
><P
>17. My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the children's sake of mine own body.</P
><P
>18. Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake against me.</P
><P
>19. All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are turned against me.</P
><P
>20. My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped with the skin of my teeth.</P
><P
>21. Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the hand of God hath touched me.</P
><P
>22. Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my flesh?</P
><P
>23. Oh that my words were now written!  oh that they were printed in a book!</P
><P
>24. That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock for ever!</P
><P
>25. For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth:</P
><P
>26. And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:</P
><P
>27. Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.</P
><P
>28. But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of the matter is found in me?</P
><P
>29. Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.</P
