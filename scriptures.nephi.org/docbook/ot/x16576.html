>19.91. Chapter 91</H1
><P
>1. HE that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.</P
><P
>2. I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God; in him will I trust.</P
><P
>3. Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence.</P
><P
>4. He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.</P
><P
>5. Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the arrow that flieth by day;</P
><P
>6. Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the destruction that wasteth at noonday.</P
><P
>7. A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.</P
><P
>8. Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.</P
><P
>9. Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation;</P
><P
>10. There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling.</P
><P
>11. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways.</P
><P
>12. They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.</P
><P
>13. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.</P
><P
>14. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.</P
><P
>15. He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.</P
><P
>16. With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.</P
