>18.13. Chapter 13</H1
><P
>1. LO, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and understood it.</P
><P
>2. What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you.</P
><P
>3. Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason with God.</P
><P
>4. But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.</P
><P
>5. O that ye would altogether hold your peace!  and it should be your wisdom.</P
><P
>6. Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.</P
><P
>7. Will ye speak wickedly for God?  and talk deceitfully for him?</P
><P
>8. Will ye accept his person?  will ye contend for God?</P
><P
>9. Is it good that he should search you out?  or as one man mocketh another, do ye so mock him?</P
><P
>10. He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.</P
><P
>11. Shall not his excellency make you afraid?  and his dread fall upon you?</P
><P
>12. Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies of clay.</P
><P
>13. Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will.</P
><P
>14. Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in mine hand?</P
><P
>15. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him.</P
><P
>16. He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come before him.</P
><P
>17. Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.</P
><P
>18. Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be justified.</P
><P
>19. Who is he that will plead with me?  for now, if I hold my tongue, I shall give up the ghost.</P
><P
>20. Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself from thee.</P
><P
>21. Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me afraid.</P
><P
>22. Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer thou me.</P
><P
>23. How many are mine iniquities and sins?  make me to know my transgression and my sin.</P
><P
>24. Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?</P
><P
>25. Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro?  and wilt thou pursue the dry stubble?</P
><P
>26. For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.</P
><P
>27. Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.</P
><P
>28. And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is moth eaten.</P
