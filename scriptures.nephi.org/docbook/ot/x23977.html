>28.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. WHEN I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers spoileth without.</P
><P
>2. And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about; they are before my face.</P
><P
>3. They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.</P
><P
>4. They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneeded the dough, until it be leavened.</P
><P
>5. In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.</P
><P
>6. For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the morning it burneth as a flaming fire.</P
><P
>7. They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that calleth unto me.</P
><P
>8. Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.</P
><P
>9. Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not: yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not.</P
><P
>10. And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.</P
><P
>11. ¶ Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to Egypt, they go to Assyria.</P
><P
>12. When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.</P
><P
>13. Woe unto them!  for they have fled from me: destruction unto them!  because they have transgressed against me: though I have redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.</P
><P
>14. And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and wine, and they rebel against me.</P
><P
>15. Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.</P
><P
>16. They return, but not to the most High: they are like a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land of Egypt.</P
