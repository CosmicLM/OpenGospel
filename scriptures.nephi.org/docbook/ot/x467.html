>1.18. Chapter 18</H1
><P
>1. AND the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</P
><P
>2. And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</P
><P
>3. And said, My Lord, if now I have found favour in thy sight, pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</P
><P
>4. Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</P
><P
>5. And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come to your servant.  And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</P
><P
>6. And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes upon the hearth.</P
><P
>7. And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</P
><P
>8. And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under the tree, and they did eat.</P
><P
>9. ¶ And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife?  And he said, Behold, in the tent.</P
><P
>10. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.  And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</P
><P
>11. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</P
><P
>12. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</P
><P
>13. And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</P
><P
>14. Is any thing too hard for the LORD?  At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son.</P
><P
>15. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.  And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</P
><P
>16. ¶ And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</P
><P
>17. And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;</P
><P
>18. Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him?</P
><P
>19. For I know him, that he will command his children and his household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD, to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</P
><P
>20. And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great, and because their sin is very grievous;</P
><P
>21. I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</P
><P
>22. And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</P
><P
>23. ¶ And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked?</P
><P
>24. Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are therein?</P
><P
>25. That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?</P
><P
>26. And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</P
><P
>27. And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes:</P
><P
>28. Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous: wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five?  And he said, If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</P
><P
>29. And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there shall be forty found there.  And he said, I will not do it for forty's sake.</P
><P
>30. And he said unto him, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there.  And he said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</P
><P
>31. And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there.  And he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.</P
><P
>32. And he said, Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there.  And he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.</P
><P
>33. And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</P
