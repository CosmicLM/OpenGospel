>1.12. Chapter 12</H1
><P
>1. NOW the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:</P
><P
>2. And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</P
><P
>3. And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.</P
><P
>4. So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.</P
><P
>5. And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</P
><P
>6. ¶ And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem, unto the plain of Moreh.  And the Canaanite was then in the land.</P
><P
>7. And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD, who appeared unto him.</P
><P
>8. And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Beth-el, and pitched his tent, having Beth-el on the west, and Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD, and called upon the name of the LORD.</P
><P
>9. And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</P
><P
>10. ¶ And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.</P
><P
>11. And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon:</P
><P
>12. Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will kill me, but they will save thee alive.</P
><P
>13. Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</P
><P
>14. ¶ And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</P
><P
>15. The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.</P
><P
>16. And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep, and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and she asses, and camels.</P
><P
>17. And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife.</P
><P
>18. And Pharaoh called Abram, and said, What is this that thou hast done unto me?  why didst thou not tell me that she was thy wife?</P
><P
>19. Why saidst thou, She is my sister?  so I might have taken her to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go thy way.</P
><P
>20. And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</P
