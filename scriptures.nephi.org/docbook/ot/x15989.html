><P
>1. PRAISE waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.</P
><P
>2. O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.</P
><P
>3. Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away.</P
><P
>4. Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.</P
><P
>5. By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:</P
><P
>6. Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power:</P
><P
>7. Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.</P
><P
>8. They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening to rejoice.</P
><P
>9. Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.</P
><P
>10. Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest the springing thereof.</P
><P
>11. Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.</P
><P
>12. They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.</P
><P
>13. The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.</P
