>18.15. Chapter 15</H1
><P
>1. THEN answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</P
><P
>2. Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?</P
><P
>3. Should he reason with unprofitable talk?  or with speeches wherewith he can do no good?</P
><P
>4. Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.</P
><P
>5. For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the tongue of the crafty.</P
><P
>6. Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lips testify against thee.</P
><P
>7. Art thou the first man that was born?  or wast thou made before the hills?</P
><P
>8. Hast thou heard the secret of God?  and dost thou restrain wisdom to thyself?</P
><P
>9. What knowest thou, that we know not?  what understandest thou, which is not in us?</P
><P
>10. With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.</P
><P
>11. Are the consolations of God small with thee?  is there any secret thing with thee?</P
><P
>12. Why doth thine heart carry thee away?  and what do thy eyes wink at,</P
><P
>13. That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?</P
><P
>14. What is man, that he should be clean?  and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</P
><P
>15. Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens are not clean in his sight.</P
><P
>16. How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh iniquity like water?</P
><P
>17. I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will declare;</P
><P
>18. Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid it:</P
><P
>19. Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed among them.</P
><P
>20. The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the number of years is hidden to the oppressor.</P
><P
>21. A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer shall come upon him.</P
><P
>22. He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he is waited for of the sword.</P
><P
>23. He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it?  he knoweth that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.</P
><P
>24. Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail against him, as a king ready to the battle.</P
><P
>25. For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth himself against the Almighty.</P
><P
>26. He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers:</P
><P
>27. Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh collops of fat on his flanks.</P
><P
>28. And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.</P
><P
>29. He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.</P
><P
>30. He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.</P
><P
>31. Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall be his recompence.</P
><P
>32. It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall not be green.</P
><P
>33. He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall cast off his flower as the olive.</P
><P
>34. For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.</P
><P
>35. They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their belly prepareth deceit.</P
