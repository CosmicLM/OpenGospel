>20.12. Chapter 12</H1
><P
>1. WHOSO loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth reproof is brutish.</P
><P
>2. A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked devices will he condemn.</P
><P
>3. A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of the righteous shall not be moved.</P
><P
>4. A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.</P
><P
>5. The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceit.</P
><P
>6. The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the mouth of the upright shall deliver them.</P
><P
>7. The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the righteous shall stand.</P
><P
>8. A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that is of a perverse heart shall be despised.</P
><P
>9. He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.</P
><P
>10. A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.</P
><P
>11. He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.</P
><P
>12. The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the righteous yieldeth fruit.</P
><P
>13. The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the just shall come out of trouble.</P
><P
>14. A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth: and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto him.</P
><P
>15. The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.</P
><P
>16. A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth shame.</P
><P
>17. He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a false witness deceit.</P
><P
>18. There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the tongue of the wise is health.</P
><P
>19. The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.</P
><P
>20. Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the counsellors of peace is joy.</P
><P
>21. There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall be filled with mischief.</P
><P
>22. Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal truly are his delight.</P
><P
>23. A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools proclaimeth foolishness.</P
><P
>24. The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful shall be under tribute.</P
><P
>25. Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word maketh it glad.</P
><P
>26. The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the way of the wicked seduceth them.</P
><P
>27. The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting: but the substance of a diligent man is precious.</P
><P
>28. In the way of righteousness is life; and in the pathway thereof there is no death.</P
