><P
>1. BLESSED be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight:</P
><P
>2. My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.</P
><P
>3. LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him!  or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!</P
><P
>4. Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth away.</P
><P
>5. Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.</P
><P
>6. Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them.</P
><P
>7. Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;</P
><P
>8. Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.</P
><P
>9. I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.</P
><P
>10. It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword.</P
><P
>11. Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood:</P
><P
>12. That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace:</P
><P
>13. That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store: that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets:</P
><P
>14. That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.</P
><P
>15. Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is that people, whose God is the LORD.</P
