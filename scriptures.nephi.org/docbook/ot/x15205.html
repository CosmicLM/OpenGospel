>19.19. Chapter 19</H1
><P
>1. THE heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth his handywork.</P
><P
>2. Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge.</P
><P
>3. There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.</P
><P
>4. Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.  In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,</P
><P
>5. Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.</P
><P
>6. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</P
><P
>7. The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.</P
><P
>8. The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.</P
><P
>9. The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.</P
><P
>10. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</P
><P
>11. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</P
><P
>12. Who can understand his errors?  cleanse thou me from secret faults.</P
><P
>13. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the great transgression.</P
><P
>14. Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.</P
