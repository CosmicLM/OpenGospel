>1.44. Chapter 44</H1
><P
>1. AND he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man's money in his sack's mouth.</P
><P
>2. And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest, and his corn money.  And he did according to the word that Joseph had spoken.</P
><P
>3. As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their asses.</P
><P
>4. And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off, Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye rewarded evil for good?</P
><P
>5. Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed he divineth?  ye have done evil in so doing.</P
><P
>6. ¶ And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</P
><P
>7. And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?  God forbid that thy servants should do according to this thing:</P
><P
>8. Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</P
><P
>9. With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die, and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</P
><P
>10. And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be blameless.</P
><P
>11. Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground, and opened every man his sack.</P
><P
>12. And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</P
><P
>13. Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and returned to the city.</P
><P
>14. ¶ And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</P
><P
>15. And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have done?  wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</P
><P
>16. And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord?  what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves?  God hath found out the iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</P
><P
>17. And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</P
><P
>18. ¶ Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh.</P
><P
>19. My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother?</P
><P
>20. And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</P
><P
>21. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him.</P
><P
>22. And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his father, his father would die.</P
><P
>23. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</P
><P
>24. And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told him the words of my lord.</P
><P
>25. And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.</P
><P
>26. And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's face, except our youngest brother be with us.</P
><P
>27. And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife bare me two sons:</P
><P
>28. And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I saw him not since:</P
><P
>29. And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</P
><P
>30. Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the lad's life;</P
><P
>31. It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</P
><P
>32. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the blame to my father for ever.</P
><P
>33. Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.</P
><P
>34. For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me?  lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my father.</P
