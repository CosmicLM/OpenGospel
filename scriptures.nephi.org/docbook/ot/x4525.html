>1. AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</P
><P
>2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.</P
><P
>3. And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.</P
><P
>4. And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.</P
><P
>5. And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.</P
><P
>6. ¶ And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.</P
><P
>7. And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness.</P
><P
>8. And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.</P
><P
>9. And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</P
><P
>10. ¶ And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.</P
><P
>11. And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.</P
><P
>12. And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish.</P
><P
>13. Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?</P
