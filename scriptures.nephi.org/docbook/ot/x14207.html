><P
>1. MY breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are ready for me.</P
><P
>2. Are there not mockers with me?  and doth not mine eye continue in their provocation?</P
><P
>3. Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that will strike hands with me?</P
><P
>4. For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.</P
><P
>5. He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his children shall fail.</P
><P
>6. He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I was as a tabret.</P
><P
>7. Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members are as a shadow.</P
><P
>8. Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall stir up himself against the hypocrite.</P
><P
>9. The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</P
><P
>10. But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot find one wise man among you.</P
><P
>11. My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughts of my heart.</P
><P
>12. They change the night into day: the light is short because of darkness.</P
><P
>13. If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the darkness.</P
><P
>14. I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thou art my mother, and my sister.</P
><P
>15. And where is now my hope?  as for my hope, who shall see it?</P
><P
>16. They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest together is in the dust.</P
