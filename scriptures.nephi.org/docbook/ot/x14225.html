>18.18. Chapter 18</H1
><P
>1. THEN answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</P
><P
>2. How long will it be ere ye make an end of words?  mark, and afterwards we will speak.</P
><P
>3. Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your sight?</P
><P
>4. He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken for thee?  and shall the rock be removed out of his place?</P
><P
>5. Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark of his fire shall not shine.</P
><P
>6. The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shall be put out with him.</P
><P
>7. The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own counsel shall cast him down.</P
><P
>8. For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon a snare.</P
><P
>9. The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevail against him.</P
><P
>10. The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in the way.</P
><P
>11. Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive him to his feet.</P
><P
>12. His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be ready at his side.</P
><P
>13. It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn of death shall devour his strength.</P
><P
>14. His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it shall bring him to the king of terrors.</P
><P
>15. It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his: brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.</P
><P
>16. His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branch be cut off.</P
><P
>17. His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have no name in the street.</P
><P
>18. He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of the world.</P
><P
>19. He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any remaining in his dwellings.</P
><P
>20. They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they that went before were affrighted.</P
><P
>21. Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.</P
