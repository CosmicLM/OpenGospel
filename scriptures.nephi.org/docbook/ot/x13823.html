>18.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. AFTER this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</P
><P
>2. And Job spake, and said,</P
><P
>3. Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which it was said, There is a man child conceived.</P
><P
>4. Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above, neither let the light shine upon it.</P
><P
>5. Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</P
><P
>6. As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</P
><P
>7. Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.</P
><P
>8. Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning.</P
><P
>9. Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day:</P
><P
>10. Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes.</P
><P
>11. Why died I not from the womb?  why did I not give up the ghost when I came out of the belly?</P
><P
>12. Why did the knees prevent me?  or why the breasts that I should suck?</P
><P
>13. For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,</P
><P
>14. With kings and counsellers of the earth, which built desolate places for themselves;</P
><P
>15. Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with silver:</P
><P
>16. Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants which never saw light.</P
><P
>17. There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest.</P
><P
>18. There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of the oppressor.</P
><P
>19. The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master.</P
><P
>20. Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life unto the bitter in soul;</P
><P
>21. Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</P
><P
>22. Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?</P
><P
>23. Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?</P
><P
>24. For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured out like the waters.</P
><P
>25. For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that which I was afraid of is come unto me.</P
><P
>26. I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yet trouble came.</P
