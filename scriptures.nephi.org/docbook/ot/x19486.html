>23.21. Chapter 21</H1
><P
>1. THE burden of the desert of the sea.  As whirlwinds in the south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a terrible land.</P
><P
>2. A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth.  Go up, O Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to cease.</P
><P
>3. Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.</P
><P
>4. My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.</P
><P
>5. Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and anoint the shield.</P
><P
>6. For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</P
><P
>7. And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</P
><P
>8. And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole nights:</P
><P
>9. And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of horsemen.  And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</P
><P
>10. O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</P
><P
>11. ¶ The burden of Dumah.  He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman, what of the night?  Watchman, what of the night?</P
><P
>12. The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.</P
><P
>13. ¶ The burden upon Arabia.  In the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.</P
><P
>14. The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.</P
><P
>15. For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</P
><P
>16. For thus hath the Lord said unto me, Within a year, according to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:</P
><P
>17. And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken it.</P
