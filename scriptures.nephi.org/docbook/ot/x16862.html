>19.106. Chapter 106</H1
><P
>1. PRAISE ye the LORD.  O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</P
><P
>2. Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD?  who can shew forth all his praise?</P
><P
>3. Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times.</P
><P
>4. Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;</P
><P
>5. That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.</P
><P
>6. We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</P
><P
>7. Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the Red sea.</P
><P
>8. Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.</P
><P
>9. He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.</P
><P
>10. And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</P
><P
>11. And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.</P
><P
>12. Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.</P
><P
>13. They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:</P
><P
>14. But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert.</P
><P
>15. And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.</P
><P
>16. They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the LORD.</P
><P
>17. The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.</P
><P
>18. And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.</P
><P
>19. They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.</P
><P
>20. Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.</P
><P
>21. They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt;</P
><P
>22. Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea.</P
><P
>23. Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.</P
><P
>24. Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:</P
><P
>25. But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the LORD.</P
><P
>26. Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:</P
><P
>27. To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.</P
><P
>28. They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.</P
><P
>29. Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.</P
><P
>30. Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.</P
><P
>31. And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.</P
><P
>32. They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:</P
><P
>33. Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</P
><P
>34. They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD commanded them:</P
><P
>35. But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.</P
><P
>36. And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.</P
><P
>37. Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,</P
><P
>38. And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.</P
><P
>39. Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.</P
><P
>40. Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.</P
><P
>41. And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them.</P
><P
>42. Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.</P
><P
>43. Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.</P
><P
>44. Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:</P
><P
>45. And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.</P
><P
>46. He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.</P
><P
>47. Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.</P
><P
>48. Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen.  Praise ye the LORD.</P
