>19.31. Chapter 31</H1
><P
>1. IN thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness.</P
><P
>2. Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.</P
><P
>3. For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.</P
><P
>4. Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for thou art my strength.</P
><P
>5. Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORD God of truth.</P
><P
>6. I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in the LORD.</P
><P
>7. I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;</P
><P
>8. And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large room.</P
><P
>9. Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.</P
><P
>10. For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.</P
><P
>11. I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see me without fled from me.</P
><P
>12. I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken vessel.</P
><P
>13. For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life.</P
><P
>14. But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.</P
><P
>15. My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me.</P
><P
>16. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy mercies' sake.</P
><P
>17. Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.</P
><P
>18. Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.</P
><P
>19. Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!</P
><P
>20. Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues.</P
><P
>21. Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city.</P
><P
>22. For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes: nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I cried unto thee.</P
><P
>23. O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.</P
><P
>24. Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.</P
