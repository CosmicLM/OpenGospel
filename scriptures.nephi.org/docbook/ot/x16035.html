>19.68. Chapter 68</H1
><P
>1. LET God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also that hate him flee before him.</P
><P
>2. As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.</P
><P
>3. But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.</P
><P
>4. Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.</P
><P
>5. A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation.</P
><P
>6. God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.</P
><P
>7. O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didst march through the wilderness; Selah:</P
><P
>8. The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.</P
><P
>9. Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.</P
><P
>10. Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast prepared of thy goodness for the poor.</P
><P
>11. The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that published it.</P
><P
>12. Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home divided the spoil.</P
><P
>13. Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.</P
><P
>14. When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon.</P
><P
>15. The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the hill of Bashan.</P
><P
>16. Why leap ye, ye high hills?  this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.</P
><P
>17. The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.</P
><P
>18. Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.</P
><P
>19. Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation.  Selah.</P
><P
>20. He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the Lord belong the issues from death.</P
><P
>21. But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.</P
><P
>22. The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my people again from the depths of the sea:</P
><P
>23. That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and the tongue of thy dogs in the same.</P
><P
>24. They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary.</P
><P
>25. The singers went before, the players on instruments followed after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.</P
><P
>26. Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the fountain of Israel.</P
><P
>27. There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.</P
><P
>28. Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that which thou hast wrought for us.</P
><P
>29. Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee.</P
><P
>30. Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.</P
><P
>31. Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.</P
><P
>32. Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto the Lord; Selah:</P
><P
>33. To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.</P
><P
>34. Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, and his strength is in the clouds.</P
><P
>35. O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.  Blessed be God.</P
