>38.9. Chapter 9</H1
><P
>1. THE burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.</P
><P
>2. And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though it be very wise.</P
><P
>3. And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</P
><P
>4. Behold, the Lord will cast her out, and he will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.</P
><P
>5. Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon shall not be inhabited.</P
><P
>6. And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of the Philistines.</P
><P
>7. And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth, even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</P
><P
>8. And I will encamp about mine house because of the army, because of him that passeth by, and because of him that returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more: for now have I seen with mine eyes.</P
><P
>9. ¶ Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass.</P
><P
>10. And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.</P
><P
>11. As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</P
><P
>12. ¶ Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day do I declare that I will render double unto thee;</P
><P
>13. When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim, and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece, and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.</P
><P
>14. And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go forth as the lightning: and the Lord GOD shall blow the trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.</P
><P
>15. The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour, and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls, and as the corners of the altar.</P
><P
>16. And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.</P
><P
>17. For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!  corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the maids.</P
