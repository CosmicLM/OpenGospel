><P
>1. O ISRAEL, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.</P
><P
>2. Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we render the calves of our lips.</P
><P
>3. Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.</P
><P
>4. ¶ I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for mine anger is turned away from him.</P
><P
>5. I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.</P
><P
>6. His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.</P
><P
>7. They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof shall be as the wine of Lebanon.</P
><P
>8. Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols?  I have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree. From me is thy fruit found.</P
><P
>9. Who is wise, and he shall understand these things?  prudent, and he shall know them?  for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall fall therein.</P
