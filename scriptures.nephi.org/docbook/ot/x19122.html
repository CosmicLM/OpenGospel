>23.3. Chapter 3</H1
><P
>1. FOR, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,</P
><P
>2. The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,</P
><P
>3. The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator.</P
><P
>4. And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</P
><P
>5. And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself proudly against the ancient, and the base against the honourable.</P
><P
>6. When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand:</P
><P
>7. In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a ruler of the people.</P
><P
>8. For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</P
><P
>9. ¶ The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not.  Woe unto their soul!  for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.</P
><P
>10. Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</P
><P
>11. Woe unto the wicked!  it shall be ill with him: for the reward of his hands shall be given him.</P
><P
>12. ¶ As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them.  O my people, they which lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</P
><P
>13. The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the people.</P
><P
>14. The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.</P
><P
>15. What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor?  saith the Lord GOD of hosts.</P
><P
>16. ¶ Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:</P
><P
>17. Therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover their secret parts.</P
><P
>18. In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and their round tires like the moon,</P
><P
>19. The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,</P
><P
>20. The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands, and the tablets, and the earrings,</P
><P
>21. The rings, and nose jewels,</P
><P
>22. The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the wimples, and the crisping pins,</P
><P
>23. The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.</P
><P
>24. And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.</P
><P
>25. Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</P
><P
>26. And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate shall sit upon the ground.</P
