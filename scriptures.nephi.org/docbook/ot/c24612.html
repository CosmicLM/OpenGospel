><P
>1. THE burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</P
><P
>2. O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear!  even cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!</P
><P
>3. Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold grievance?  for spoiling and violence are before me: and there are that raise up strife and contention.</P
><P
>4. Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.</P
><P
>5. ¶ Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvellously: for I will work a work in your days, which ye will not believe, though it be told you.</P
><P
>6. For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwellingplaces that are not theirs.</P
><P
>7. They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their dignity shall proceed of themselves.</P
><P
>8. Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far; they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.</P
><P
>9. They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the sand.</P
><P
>10. And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they shall heap dust, and take it.</P
><P
>11. Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power unto his god.</P
><P
>12. ¶ Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?  we shall not die.  O LORD, thou hast ordained them for judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for correction.</P
><P
>13. Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?</P
><P
>14. And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping things, that have no ruler over them?</P
><P
>15. They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</P
><P
>16. Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their meat plenteous.</P
><P
>17. Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations?</P
