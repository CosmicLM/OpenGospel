>18.37. Chapter 37</H1
><P
>1. AT this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.</P
><P
>2. Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth.</P
><P
>3. He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto the ends of the earth.</P
><P
>4. After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.</P
><P
>5. God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth he, which we cannot comprehend.</P
><P
>6. For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.</P
><P
>7. He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his work.</P
><P
>8. Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.</P
><P
>9. Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.</P
><P
>10. By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the waters is straitened.</P
><P
>11. Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth his bright cloud:</P
><P
>12. And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in the earth.</P
><P
>13. He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land, or for mercy.</P
><P
>14. Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.</P
><P
>15. Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of his cloud to shine?</P
><P
>16. Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?</P
><P
>17. How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the south wind?</P
><P
>18. Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as a molten looking glass?</P
><P
>19. Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.</P
><P
>20. Shall it be told him that I speak?  if a man speak, surely he shall be swallowed up.</P
><P
>21. And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.</P
><P
>22. Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible majesty.</P
><P
>23. Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will not afflict.</P
><P
>24. Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise of heart.</P
