>1. THE burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.</P
><P
>2. I have loved you, saith the LORD.  Yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us?  Was not Esau Jacob's brother?  saith the LORD: yet I loved Jacob,</P
><P
>3. And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste for the dragons of the wilderness.</P
><P
>4. Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever.</P
><P
>5. And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be magnified from the border of Israel.</P
><P
>6. ¶ A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then I be a father, where is mine honour?  and if I be a master, where is my fear?  saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name.  And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name?</P
><P
>7. Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee?  In that ye say, The table of the LORD is contemptible.</P
><P
>8. And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil?  and if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil?  offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person?  saith the LORD of hosts.</P
><P
>9. And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons?  saith the LORD of hosts.</P
><P
>10. Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for nought?  neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought.  I have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will I accept an offering at your hand.</P
><P
>11. For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the LORD of hosts.</P
><P
>12. ¶ But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is contemptible.</P
><P
>13. Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it!  and ye have snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an offering: should I accept this of your hand?  saith the LORD.</P
><P
>14. But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male, and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the Lord a corrupt thing: for I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the heathen.</P
