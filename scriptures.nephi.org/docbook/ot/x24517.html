>33.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. HEAR ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.</P
><P
>2. Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with his people, and he will plead with Israel.</P
><P
>3. O my people, what have I done unto thee?  and wherein have I wearied thee?  testify against me.</P
><P
>4. For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.</P
><P
>5. O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.</P
><P
>6. ¶ Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before the high God?  shall I come before him with burnt offerings, with calves of a year old?</P
><P
>7. Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil?  shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?</P
><P
>8. He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</P
><P
>9. The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it.</P
><P
>10. ¶ Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?</P
><P
>11. Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the bag of deceitful weights?</P
><P
>12. For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is deceitful in their mouth.</P
><P
>13. Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in making thee desolate because of thy sins.</P
><P
>14. Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give up to the sword.</P
><P
>15. Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet wine, but shalt not drink wine.</P
><P
>16. ¶ For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.</P
