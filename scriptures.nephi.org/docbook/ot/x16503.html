>19.89. Chapter 89</H1
><P
>1. I WILL sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.</P
><P
>2. For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.</P
><P
>3. I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David my servant,</P
><P
>4. Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations.  Selah.</P
><P
>5. And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.</P
><P
>6. For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD?  who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?</P
><P
>7. God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.</P
><P
>8. O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee?  or to thy faithfulness round about thee?</P
><P
>9. Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them.</P
><P
>10. Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.</P
><P
>11. The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.</P
><P
>12. The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.</P
><P
>13. Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy right hand.</P
><P
>14. Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.</P
><P
>15. Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.</P
><P
>16. In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.</P
><P
>17. For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted.</P
><P
>18. For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king.</P
><P
>19. Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people.</P
><P
>20. I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:</P
><P
>21. With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall strengthen him.</P
><P
>22. The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness afflict him.</P
><P
>23. And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him.</P
><P
>24. But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my name shall his horn be exalted.</P
><P
>25. I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.</P
><P
>26. He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</P
><P
>27. Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.</P
><P
>28. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him.</P
><P
>29. His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</P
><P
>30. If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;</P
><P
>31. If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;</P
><P
>32. Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes.</P
><P
>33. Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.</P
><P
>34. My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone out of my lips.</P
><P
>35. Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.</P
><P
>36. His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.</P
><P
>37. It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven.  Selah.</P
><P
>38. But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed.</P
><P
>39. Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.</P
><P
>40. Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his strong holds to ruin.</P
><P
>41. All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his neighbours.</P
><P
>42. Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.</P
><P
>43. Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made him to stand in the battle.</P
><P
>44. Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to the ground.</P
><P
>45. The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered him with shame.  Selah.</P
><P
>46. How long, LORD?  wilt thou hide thyself for ever?  shall thy wrath burn like fire?</P
><P
>47. Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?</P
><P
>48. What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death?  shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?  Selah.</P
><P
>49. Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarest unto David in thy truth?</P
><P
>50. Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;</P
><P
>51. Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.</P
><P
>52. Blessed be the LORD for evermore.  Amen, and Amen.</P
