>10.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. AND it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;</P
><P
>2. That the king said unto Nathan the prophet, See now, I dwell in an house of cedar, but the ark of God dwelleth within curtains.</P
><P
>3. And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.</P
><P
>4. ¶ And it came to pass that night, that the word of the LORD came unto Nathan, saying,</P
><P
>5. Go and tell my servant David, Thus saith the LORD, Shalt thou build me an house for me to dwell in?</P
><P
>6. Whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have walked in a tent and in a tabernacle.</P
><P
>7. In all the places wherein I have walked with all the children of Israel spake I a word with any of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my people Israel, saying, Why build ye not me an house of cedar?</P
><P
>8. Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</P
><P
>9. And I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight, and have made thee a great name, like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth.</P
><P
>10. Moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own, and move no more; neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more, as beforetime,</P
><P
>11. And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies.  Also the LORD telleth thee that he will make thee an house.</P
><P
>12. ¶ And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.</P
><P
>13. He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever.</P
><P
>14. I will be his father, and he shall be my son.  If he commit iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the children of men:</P
><P
>15. But my mercy shall not depart away from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I put away before thee.</P
><P
>16. And thine house and thy kingdom shall be established for ever before thee: thy throne shall be established for ever.</P
><P
>17. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.</P
><P
>18. ¶ Then went king David in, and sat before the LORD, and he said, Who am I, O Lord GOD?  and what is my house, that thou hast brought me hitherto?</P
><P
>19. And this was yet a small thing in thy sight, O Lord GOD; but thou hast spoken also of thy servant's house for a great while to come.  And is this the manner of man, O Lord GOD?</P
><P
>20. And what can David say more unto thee?  for thou, Lord GOD, knowest thy servant.</P
><P
>21. For thy word's sake, and according to thine own heart, hast thou done all these great things, to make thy servant know them.</P
><P
>22. Wherefore thou art great, O LORD God: for there is none like thee, neither is there any God beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our ears.</P
><P
>23. And what one nation in the earth is like thy people, even like Israel, whom God went to redeem for a people to himself, and to make him a name, and to do for you great things and terrible, for thy land, before thy people, which thou redeemedst to thee from Egypt, from the nations and their gods?</P
><P
>24. For thou hast confirmed to thyself thy people Israel to be a people unto thee for ever: and thou, LORD, art become their God.</P
><P
>25. And now, O LORD God, the word that thou hast spoken concerning thy servant, and concerning his house, establish it for ever, and do as thou hast said.</P
><P
>26. And let thy name be magnified for ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God over Israel: and let the house of thy servant David be established before thee.</P
><P
>27. For thou, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, hast revealed to thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house: therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to pray this prayer unto thee.</P
><P
>28. And now, O Lord GOD, thou art that God, and thy words be true, and thou hast promised this goodness unto thy servant:</P
><P
>29. Therefore now let it please thee to bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee: for thou, O Lord GOD, hast spoken it: and with thy blessing let the house of thy servant be blessed for ever.</P
