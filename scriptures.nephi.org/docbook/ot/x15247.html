>19.22. Chapter 22</H1
><P
>1. MY God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?  why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?</P
><P
>2. O my God, I cry in the daytime, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.</P
><P
>3. But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.</P
><P
>4. Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliver them.</P
><P
>5. They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee, and were not confounded.</P
><P
>6. But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.</P
><P
>7. All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,</P
><P
>8. He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.</P
><P
>9. But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.</P
><P
>10. I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.</P
><P
>11. Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.</P
><P
>12. Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have beset me round.</P
><P
>13. They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.</P
><P
>14. I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint: my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.</P
><P
>15. My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.</P
><P
>16. For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.</P
><P
>17. I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.</P
><P
>18. They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.</P
><P
>19. But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee to help me.</P
><P
>20. Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.</P
><P
>21. Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns.</P
><P
>22. I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee.</P
><P
>23. Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.</P
><P
>24. For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.</P
><P
>25. My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.</P
><P
>26. The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.</P
><P
>27. All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.</P
><P
>28. For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among the nations.</P
><P
>29. All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alive his own soul.</P
><P
>30. A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.</P
><P
>31. They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.</P
