>18.8. Chapter 8</H1
><P
>1. THEN answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,</P
><P
>2. How long wilt thou speak these things?  and how long shall the words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?</P
><P
>3. Doth God pervert judgment?  or doth the Almighty pervert justice?</P
><P
>4. If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their transgression;</P
><P
>5. If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty;</P
><P
>6. If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.</P
><P
>7. Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase.</P
><P
>8. For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers:</P
><P
>9. (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:)</P
><P
>10. Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of their heart?</P
><P
>11. Can the rush grow up without mire?  can the flag grow without water?</P
><P
>12. Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it withereth before any other herb.</P
><P
>13. So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish:</P
><P
>14. Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web.</P
><P
>15. He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure.</P
><P
>16. He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden.</P
><P
>17. His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of stones.</P
><P
>18. If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying, I have not seen thee.</P
><P
>19. Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow.</P
><P
>20. Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he help the evil doers:</P
><P
>21. Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing.</P
><P
>22. They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.</P
