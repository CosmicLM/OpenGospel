>20.17. Chapter 17</H1
><P
>1. BETTER is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house full of sacrifices with strife.</P
><P
>2. A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame, and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.</P
><P
>3. The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but the LORD trieth the hearts.</P
><P
>4. A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear to a naughty tongue.</P
><P
>5. Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.</P
><P
>6. Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of children are their fathers.</P
><P
>7. Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips a prince.</P
><P
>8. A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it: whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.</P
><P
>9. He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that repeateth a matter separateth very friends.</P
><P
>10. A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred stripes into a fool.</P
><P
>11. An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel messenger shall be sent against him.</P
><P
>12. Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool in his folly.</P
><P
>13. Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his house.</P
><P
>14. The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.</P
><P
>15. He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.</P
><P
>16. Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?</P
><P
>17. A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for adversity.</P
><P
>18. A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh surety in the presence of his friend.</P
><P
>19. He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.</P
><P
>20. He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.</P
><P
>21. He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the father of a fool hath no joy.</P
><P
>22. A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit drieth the bones.</P
><P
>23. A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the ways of judgment.</P
><P
>24. Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth.</P
><P
>25. A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her that bare him.</P
><P
>26. Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for equity.</P
><P
>27. He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of understanding is of an excellent spirit.</P
><P
>28. Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.</P
