>19.139. Chapter 139</H1
><P
>1. O LORD, thou hast searched me, and known me.</P
><P
>2. Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off.</P
><P
>3. Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted with all my ways.</P
><P
>4. For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou knowest it altogether.</P
><P
>5. Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon me.</P
><P
>6. Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</P
><P
>7. Whither shall I go from thy spirit?  or whither shall I flee from thy presence?</P
><P
>8. If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.</P
><P
>9. If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;</P
><P
>10. Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me.</P
><P
>11. If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me.</P
><P
>12. Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.</P
><P
>13. For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my mother's womb.</P
><P
>14. I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made: marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.</P
><P
>15. My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret, and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</P
><P
>16. Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.</P
><P
>17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God!  how great is the sum of them!</P
><P
>18. If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand: when I awake, I am still with thee.</P
><P
>19. Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me therefore, ye bloody men.</P
><P
>20. For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain.</P
><P
>21. Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee?  and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?</P
><P
>22. I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.</P
><P
>23. Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my thoughts:</P
><P
>24. And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.</P
