><P
>1. UNTO thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.</P
><P
>2. O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine enemies triumph over me.</P
><P
>3. Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamed which transgress without cause.</P
><P
>4. Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.</P
><P
>5. Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.</P
><P
>6. Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old.</P
><P
>7. Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O LORD.</P
><P
>8. Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners in the way.</P
><P
>9. The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach his way.</P
><P
>10. All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies.</P
><P
>11. For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great.</P
><P
>12. What man is he that feareth the LORD?  him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.</P
><P
>13. His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the earth.</P
><P
>14. The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will shew them his covenant.</P
><P
>15. Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet out of the net.</P
><P
>16. Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted.</P
><P
>17. The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of my distresses.</P
><P
>18. Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.</P
><P
>19. Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred.</P
><P
>20. O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I put my trust in thee.</P
><P
>21. Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.</P
><P
>22. Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.</P
