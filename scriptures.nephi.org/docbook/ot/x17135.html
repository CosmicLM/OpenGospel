>2. Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.</P
><P
>3. They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.</P
><P
>4. Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.</P
><P
>5. O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!</P
><P
>6. Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.</P
><P
>7. I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.</P
><P
>8. I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.</P
><P
>9. Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?  by taking heed thereto according to thy word.</P
><P
>10. With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander from thy commandments.</P
><P
>11. Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.</P
><P
>12. Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.</P
><P
>13. With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.</P
><P
>14. I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.</P
><P
>15. I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.</P
><P
>16. I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy word.</P
><P
>17. Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.</P
><P
>18. Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.</P
><P
>19. I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from me.</P
><P
>20. My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.</P
><P
>21. Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.</P
><P
>22. Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.</P
><P
>23. Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes.</P
><P
>24. Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.</P
><P
>25. My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to thy word.</P
><P
>26. I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy statutes.</P
><P
>27. Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk of thy wondrous works.</P
><P
>28. My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according unto thy word.</P
><P
>29. Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law graciously.</P
><P
>30. I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid before me.</P
><P
>31. I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.</P
><P
>32. I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.</P
><P
>33. Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.</P
><P
>34. Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.</P
><P
>35. Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.</P
><P
>36. Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.</P
><P
>37. Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.</P
><P
>38. Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.</P
><P
>39. Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.</P
><P
>40. Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy righteousness.</P
><P
>41. Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.</P
><P
>42. So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me: for I trust in thy word.</P
><P
>43. And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.</P
><P
>44. So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.</P
><P
>45. And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.</P
><P
>46. I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.</P
><P
>47. And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.</P
><P
>48. My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.</P
><P
>49. Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.</P
><P
>50. This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath quickened me.</P
><P
>51. The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not declined from thy law.</P
><P
>52. I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.</P
><P
>53. Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.</P
><P
>54. Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.</P
><P
>55. I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.</P
><P
>56. This I had, because I kept thy precepts.</P
><P
>57. Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy words.</P
><P
>58. I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto me according to thy word.</P
><P
>59. I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.</P
><P
>60. I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.</P
><P
>61. The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not forgotten thy law.</P
><P
>62. At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.</P
><P
>63. I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.</P
><P
>64. The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.</P
><P
>65. Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.</P
><P
>66. Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy commandments.</P
><P
>67. Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy word.</P
><P
>68. Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.</P
><P
>69. The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart.</P
><P
>70. Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.</P
><P
>71. It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.</P
><P
>72. The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.</P
><P
>73. Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.</P
><P
>74. They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.</P
><P
>75. I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.</P
><P
>76. Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.</P
><P
>77. Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy law is my delight.</P
><P
>78. Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.</P
><P
>79. Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.</P
><P
>80. Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.</P
><P
>81. My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.</P
><P
>82. Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?</P
><P
>83. For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.</P
><P
>84. How many are the days of thy servant?  when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?</P
><P
>85. The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.</P
><P
>86. All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me.</P
><P
>87. They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.</P
><P
>88. Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.</P
><P
>89. For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.</P
><P
>90. Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast established the earth, and it abideth.</P
><P
>91. They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all are thy servants.</P
><P
>92. Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.</P
><P
>93. I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast quickened me.</P
><P
>94. I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.</P
><P
>95. The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will consider thy testimonies.</P
><P
>96. I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is exceeding broad.</P
><P
>97. O how love I thy law!  it is my meditation all the day.</P
><P
>98. Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.</P
><P
>99. I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.</P
><P
>100. I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.</P
><P
>101. I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.</P
><P
>102. I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught me.</P
><P
>103. How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!</P
><P
>104. Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.</P
><P
>105. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.</P
><P
>106. I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</P
><P
>107. I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto thy word.</P
><P
>108. Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.</P
><P
>109. My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy law.</P
><P
>110. The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy precepts.</P
><P
>111. Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they are the rejoicing of my heart.</P
><P
>112. I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.</P
><P
>113. I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.</P
><P
>114. Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.</P
><P
>115. Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments of my God.</P
><P
>116. Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me not be ashamed of my hope.</P
><P
>117. Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually.</P
><P
>118. Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes: for their deceit is falsehood.</P
><P
>119. Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross: therefore I love thy testimonies.</P
><P
>120. My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.</P
><P
>121. I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine oppressors.</P
><P
>122. Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress me.</P
><P
>123. Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.</P
><P
>124. Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.</P
><P
>125. I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.</P
><P
>126. It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void thy law.</P
><P
