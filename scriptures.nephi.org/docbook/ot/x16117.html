>19.71. Chapter 71</H1
><P
>1. IN thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to confusion.</P
><P
>2. Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: incline thine ear unto me, and save me.</P
><P
>3. Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and my fortress.</P
><P
>4. Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.</P
><P
>5. For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my youth.</P
><P
>6. By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually of thee.</P
><P
>7. I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.</P
><P
>8. Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all the day.</P
><P
>9. Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth.</P
><P
>10. For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,</P
><P
>11. Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for there is none to deliver him.</P
><P
>12. O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.</P
><P
>13. Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek my hurt.</P
><P
>14. But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more.</P
><P
>15. My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.</P
><P
>16. I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention of thy righteousness, even of thine only.</P
><P
>17. O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works.</P
><P
>18. Now also when I am old and grayheaded, O God, forsake me not; until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy power to every one that is to come.</P
><P
>19. Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done great things: O God, who is like unto thee!</P
><P
>20. Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of the earth.</P
><P
>21. Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.</P
><P
>22. I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.</P
><P
>23. My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.</P
><P
>24. My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt.</P
