>18.33. Chapter 33</H1
><P
>1. WHEREFORE, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to all my words.</P
><P
>2. Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in my mouth.</P
><P
>3. My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips shall utter knowledge clearly.</P
><P
>4. The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life.</P
><P
>5. If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, stand up.</P
><P
>6. Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am formed out of the clay.</P
><P
>7. Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my hand be heavy upon thee.</P
><P
>8. Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the voice of thy words, saying,</P
><P
>9. I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.</P
><P
>10. Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for his enemy,</P
><P
>11. He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.</P
><P
>12. Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that God is greater than man.</P
><P
>13. Why dost thou strive against him?  for he giveth not account of any of his matters.</P
><P
>14. For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.</P
><P
>15. In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;</P
><P
>16. Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their instruction,</P
><P
>17. That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from man.</P
><P
>18. He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from perishing by the sword.</P
><P
>19. He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with strong pain:</P
><P
>20. So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.</P
><P
>21. His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his bones that were not seen stick out.</P
><P
>22. Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the destroyers.</P
><P
>23. If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:</P
><P
>24. Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.</P
><P
>25. His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to the days of his youth:</P
><P
>26. He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto man his righteousness.</P
><P
>27. He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;</P
><P
>28. He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see the light.</P
><P
>29. Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,</P
><P
>30. To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light of the living.</P
><P
>31. Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will speak.</P
><P
>32. If thou hast any thing to say, answer me: speak, for I desire to justify thee.</P
><P
>33. If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach thee wisdom.</P
