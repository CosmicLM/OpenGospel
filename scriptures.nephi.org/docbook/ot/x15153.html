>19.18. Chapter 18</H1
><P
>1. I WILL love thee, O LORD, my strength.</P
><P
>2. The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</P
><P
>3. I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.</P
><P
>4. The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.</P
><P
>5. The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death prevented me.</P
><P
>6. In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</P
><P
>7. Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.</P
><P
>8. There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.</P
><P
>9. He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was under his feet.</P
><P
>10. And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</P
><P
>11. He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</P
><P
>12. At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire.</P
><P
>13. The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.</P
><P
>14. Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.</P
><P
>15. Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</P
><P
>16. He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.</P
><P
>17. He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hated me: for they were too strong for me.</P
><P
>18. They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.</P
><P
>19. He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.</P
><P
>20. The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.</P
><P
>21. For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.</P
><P
>22. For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.</P
><P
>23. I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.</P
><P
>24. Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.</P
><P
>25. With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;</P
><P
>26. With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.</P
><P
>27. For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks.</P
><P
>28. For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten my darkness.</P
><P
>29. For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall.</P
><P
>30. As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.</P
><P
>31. For who is God save the LORD?  or who is a rock save our God?</P
><P
>32. It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect.</P
><P
>33. He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my high places.</P
><P
>34. He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken by mine arms.</P
><P
>35. Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.</P
><P
>36. Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.</P
><P
>37. I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I turn again till they were consumed.</P
><P
>38. I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are fallen under my feet.</P
><P
>39. For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.</P
><P
>40. Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I might destroy them that hate me.</P
><P
>41. They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD, but he answered them not.</P
><P
>42. Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did cast them out as the dirt in the streets.</P
><P
>43. Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have not known shall serve me.</P
><P
>44. As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers shall submit themselves unto me.</P
><P
>45. The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places.</P
><P
>46. The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.</P
><P
>47. It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.</P
><P
>48. He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from the violent man.</P
><P
>49. Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.</P
><P
>50. Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.</P
