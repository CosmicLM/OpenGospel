>18.20. Chapter 20</H1
><P
>1. THEN answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</P
><P
>2. Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.</P
><P
>3. I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my understanding causeth me to answer.</P
><P
>4. Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,</P
><P
>5. That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the hypocrite but for a moment?</P
><P
>6. Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds;</P
><P
>7. Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say, Where is he?</P
><P
>8. He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.</P
><P
>9. The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shall his place any more behold him.</P
><P
>10. His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shall restore their goods.</P
><P
>11. His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie down with him in the dust.</P
><P
>12. Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it under his tongue;</P
><P
>13. Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still within his mouth:</P
><P
>14. Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps within him.</P
><P
>15. He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again: God shall cast them out of his belly.</P
><P
>16. He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slay him.</P
><P
>17. He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey and butter.</P
><P
>18. That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not swallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.</P
><P
>19. Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;</P
><P
>20. Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of that which he desired.</P
><P
>21. There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man look for his goods.</P
><P
>22. In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.</P
><P
>23. When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.</P
><P
>24. He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall strike him through.</P
><P
>25. It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.</P
><P
>26. All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in his tabernacle.</P
><P
>27. The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise up against him.</P
><P
>28. The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flow away in the day of his wrath.</P
><P
>29. This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage appointed unto him by God.</P
