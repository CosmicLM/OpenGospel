>18.41. Chapter 41</H1
><P
>1. CANST thou draw out leviathan with an hook?  or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?</P
><P
>2. Canst thou put an hook into his nose?  or bore his jaw through with a thorn?</P
><P
>3. Will he make many supplications unto thee?  will he speak soft words unto thee?</P
><P
>4. Will he make a covenant with thee?  wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?</P
><P
>5. Wilt thou play with him as with a bird?  or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?</P
><P
>6. Shall the companions make a banquet of him?  shall they part him among the merchants?</P
><P
>7. Canst thou fill his skin with barbed iron?  or his head with fish spears?</P
><P
>8. Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.</P
><P
>9. Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?</P
><P
>10. None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before me?</P
><P
>11. Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him?  whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.</P
><P
>12. I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.</P
><P
>13. Who can discover the face of his garment?  or who can come to him with his double bridle?</P
><P
>14. Who can open the doors of his face?  his teeth are terrible round about.</P
><P
>15. His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.</P
><P
>16. One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.</P
><P
>17. They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.</P
><P
>18. By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.</P
><P
>19. Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.</P
><P
>20. Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.</P
><P
>21. His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.</P
><P
>22. In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.</P
><P
>23. The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.</P
><P
>24. His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.</P
><P
>25. When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.</P
><P
>26. The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.</P
><P
>27. He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.</P
><P
>28. The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into stubble.</P
><P
>29. Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.</P
><P
>30. Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.</P
><P
>31. He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.</P
><P
>32. He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.</P
><P
>33. Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.</P
><P
>34. He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.</P
