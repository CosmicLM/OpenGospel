>19.10. Chapter 10</H1
><P
>1. WHY standest thou afar off, O LORD?  why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</P
><P
>2. The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.</P
><P
>3. For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.</P
><P
>4. The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.</P
><P
>5. His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.</P
><P
>6. He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall never be in adversity.</P
><P
>7. His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue is mischief and vanity.</P
><P
>8. He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.</P
><P
>9. He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.</P
><P
>10. He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.</P
><P
>11. He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see it.</P
><P
>12. Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.</P
><P
>13. Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God?  he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.</P
><P
>14. Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.</P
><P
>15. Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</P
><P
>16. The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished out of his land.</P
><P
>17. LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:</P
><P
>18. To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.</P
