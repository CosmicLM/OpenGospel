>21.1. Chapter 1</H1
><P
>1. THE words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.</P
><P
>2. Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.</P
><P
>3. What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under the sun?</P
><P
>4. One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.</P
><P
>5. The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose.</P
><P
>6. The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth again according to his circuits.</P
><P
>7. All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return again.</P
><P
>8. All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.</P
><P
>9. The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.</P
><P
>10. Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?  it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</P
><P
>11. There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.</P
><P
>12. ¶ I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.</P
><P
>13. And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised therewith.</P
><P
>14. I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and, behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.</P
><P
>15. That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which is wanting cannot be numbered.</P
><P
>16. I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</P
><P
>17. And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.</P
><P
>18. For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.</P
