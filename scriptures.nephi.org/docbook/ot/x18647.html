>20.31. Chapter 31</H1
><P
>1. THE words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him.</P
><P
>2. What, my son?  and what, the son of my womb?  and what, the son of my vows?</P
><P
>3. Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings.</P
><P
>4. It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:</P
><P
>5. Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</P
><P
>6. Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.</P
><P
>7. Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.</P
><P
>8. Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction.</P
><P
>9. Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.</P
><P
>10. ¶ Who can find a virtuous woman?  for her price is far above rubies.</P
><P
>11. The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need of spoil.</P
><P
>12. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</P
><P
>13. She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.</P
><P
>14. She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.</P
><P
>15. She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her household, and a portion to her maidens.</P
><P
>16. She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard.</P
><P
>17. She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</P
><P
>18. She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.</P
><P
>19. She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.</P
><P
>20. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.</P
><P
>21. She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.</P
><P
>22. She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk and purple.</P
><P
>23. Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land.</P
><P
>24. She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant.</P
><P
>25. Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.</P
><P
>26. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.</P
><P
>27. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.</P
><P
>28. Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praiseth her.</P
><P
>29. Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</P
><P
>30. Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</P
><P
>31. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise her in the gates.</P
