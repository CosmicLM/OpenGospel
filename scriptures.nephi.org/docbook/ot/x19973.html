>23.42. Chapter 42</H1
><P
>1. BEHOLD my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.</P
><P
>2. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street.</P
><P
>3. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.</P
><P
>4. He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.</P
><P
>5. ¶ Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:</P
><P
>6. I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;</P
><P
>7. To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.</P
><P
>8. I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give to another, neither my praise to graven images.</P
><P
>9. Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.</P
><P
>10. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.</P
><P
>11. Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice, the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.</P
><P
>12. Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in the islands.</P
><P
>13. The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall prevail against his enemies.</P
><P
>14. I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I will destroy and devour at once.</P
><P
>15. I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up the pools.</P
><P
>16. And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight.  These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.</P
><P
>17. ¶ They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are our gods.</P
><P
>18. Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.</P
><P
>19. Who is blind, but my servant?  or deaf, as my messenger that I sent?  who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the LORD's servant?</P
><P
>20. Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears, but he heareth not.</P
><P
>21. The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will magnify the law, and make it honourable.</P
><P
>22. But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith, Restore.</P
><P
>23. Who among you will give ear to this?  who will hearken and hear for the time to come?</P
><P
>24. Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers?  did not the LORD, he against whom we have sinned?  for they would not walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.</P
><P
>25. Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</P
