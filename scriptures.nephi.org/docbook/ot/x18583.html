>20.29. Chapter 29</H1
><P
>1. HE, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</P
><P
>2. When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.</P
><P
>3. Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.</P
><P
>4. The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.</P
><P
>5. A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.</P
><P
>6. In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.</P
><P
>7. The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.</P
><P
>8. Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away wrath.</P
><P
>9. If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.</P
><P
>10. The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.</P
><P
>11. A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.</P
><P
>12. If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.</P
><P
>13. The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD lighteneth both their eyes.</P
><P
>14. The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.</P
><P
>15. The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.</P
><P
>16. When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.</P
><P
>17. Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.</P
><P
>18. Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.</P
><P
>19. A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.</P
><P
>20. Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words?  there is more hope of a fool than of him.</P
><P
>21. He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.</P
><P
>22. An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.</P
><P
>23. A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the humble in spirit.</P
><P
>24. Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth cursing, and bewrayeth it not.</P
><P
>25. The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the LORD shall be safe.</P
><P
>26. Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD.</P
><P
>27. An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.</P
