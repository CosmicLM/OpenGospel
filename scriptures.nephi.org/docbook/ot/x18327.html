>20.21. Chapter 21</H1
><P
>1. THE king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.</P
><P
>2. Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD pondereth the hearts.</P
><P
>3. To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than sacrifice.</P
><P
>4. An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.</P
><P
>5. The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.</P
><P
>6. The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed to and fro of them that seek death.</P
><P
>7. The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they refuse to do judgment.</P
><P
>8. The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure, his work is right.</P
><P
>9. It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.</P
><P
>10. The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.</P
><P
>11. When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.</P
><P
>12. The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.</P
><P
>13. Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.</P
><P
>14. A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom strong wrath.</P
><P
>15. It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.</P
><P
>16. The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain in the congregation of the dead.</P
><P
>17. He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth wine and oil shall not be rich.</P
><P
>18. The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the transgressor for the upright.</P
><P
>19. It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a contentious and an angry woman.</P
><P
>20. There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.</P
><P
>21. He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life, righteousness, and honour.</P
><P
>22. A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down the strength of the confidence thereof.</P
><P
>23. Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from troubles.</P
><P
>24. Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud wrath.</P
><P
>25. The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse to labour.</P
><P
>26. He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous giveth and spareth not.</P
><P
>27. The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?</P
><P
>28. A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth speaketh constantly.</P
><P
>29. A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he directeth his way.</P
><P
>30. There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD.</P
><P
>31. The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is of the LORD.</P
