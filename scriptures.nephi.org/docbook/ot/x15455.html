>19.34. Chapter 34</H1
><P
>1. I WILL bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continually be in my mouth.</P
><P
>2. My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hear thereof, and be glad.</P
><P
>3. O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.</P
><P
>4. I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all my fears.</P
><P
>5. They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were not ashamed.</P
><P
>6. This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.</P
><P
>7. The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</P
><P
>8. O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him.</P
><P
>9. O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them that fear him.</P
><P
>10. The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the LORD shall not want any good thing.</P
><P
>11. Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the LORD.</P
><P
>12. What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?</P
><P
>13. Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.</P
><P
>14. Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.</P
><P
>15. The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open unto their cry.</P
><P
>16. The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</P
><P
>17. The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</P
><P
>18. The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.</P
><P
>19. Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD delivereth him out of them all.</P
><P
>20. He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.</P
><P
>21. Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate.</P
><P
>22. The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate.</P
