>38.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. I LIFTED up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with a measuring line in his hand.</P
><P
>2. Then said I, Whither goest thou?  And he said unto me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what is the length thereof.</P
><P
>3. And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,</P
><P
>4. And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the multitude of men and cattle therein:</P
><P
>5. For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</P
><P
>6. ¶ Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heaven, saith the LORD.</P
><P
>7. Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon.</P
><P
>8. For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</P
><P
>9. For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me.</P
><P
>10. ¶ Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.</P
><P
>11. And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.</P
><P
>12. And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land, and shall choose Jerusalem again.</P
><P
>13. Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up out of his holy habitation.</P
