>14.14. Chapter 14</H1
><P
>1. SO Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.  In his days the land was quiet ten years.</P
><P
>2. And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the LORD his God:</P
><P
>3. For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:</P
><P
>4. And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.</P
><P
>5. Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.</P
><P
>6. ¶ And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest, and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given him rest.</P
><P
>7. Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every side.  So they built and prospered.</P
><P
>8. And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.</P
><P
>9. ¶ And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and came unto Mareshah.</P
><P
>10. Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.</P
><P
>11. And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude.  O LORD, thou art our God; let not man prevail against thee.</P
><P
>12. So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa and before Judah; and the Ethiopians fled.</P
><P
>13. And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD, and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.</P
><P
>14. And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities; for there was exceeding much spoil in them.</P
><P
>15. They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.</P
