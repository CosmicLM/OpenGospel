>1.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. THUS the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</P
><P
>2. And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</P
><P
>3. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made.</P
><P
>4. ¶ These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</P
><P
>5. And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man to till the ground.</P
><P
>6. But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</P
><P
>7. And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.</P
><P
>8. ¶ And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</P
><P
>9. And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</P
><P
>10. And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</P
><P
>11. The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</P
><P
>12. And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the onyx stone.</P
><P
>13. And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</P
><P
>14. And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which goeth toward the east of Assyria.  And the fourth river is Euphrates.</P
><P
>15. And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</P
><P
>16. And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:</P
><P
>17. But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</P
><P
>18. ¶ And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</P
><P
>19. And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.</P
><P
>20. And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found an help meet for him.</P
><P
>21. And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof;</P
><P
>22. And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</P
><P
>23. And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</P
><P
>24. Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</P
><P
>25. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</P
