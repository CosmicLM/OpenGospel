>19.104. Chapter 104</H1
><P
>1. BLESS the LORD, O my soul.  O LORD my God, thou art very great; thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</P
><P
>2. Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:</P
><P
>3. Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:</P
><P
>4. Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:</P
><P
>5. Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.</P
><P
>6. Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.</P
><P
>7. At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.</P
><P
>8. They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.</P
><P
>9. Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.</P
><P
>10. He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.</P
><P
>11. They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.</P
><P
>12. By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.</P
><P
>13. He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.</P
><P
>14. He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;</P
><P
>15. And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.</P
><P
>16. The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</P
><P
>17. Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.</P
><P
>18. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.</P
><P
>19. He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going down.</P
><P
>20. Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth.</P
><P
>21. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God.</P
><P
>22. The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens.</P
><P
>23. Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the evening.</P
><P
>24. O LORD, how manifold are thy works!  in wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy riches.</P
><P
>25. So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts.</P
><P
>26. There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.</P
><P
>27. These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.</P
><P
>28. That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.</P
><P
>29. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.</P
><P
>30. Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.</P
><P
>31. The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.</P
><P
>32. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the hills, and they smoke.</P
><P
>33. I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praise to my God while I have my being.</P
><P
>34. My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the LORD.</P
><P
>35. Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the wicked be no more.  Bless thou the LORD, O my soul.  Praise ye the LORD.</P
