>18.39. Chapter 39</H1
><P
>1. KNOWEST thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring forth?  or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?</P
><P
>2. Canst thou number the months that they fulfil?  or knowest thou the time when they bring forth?</P
><P
>3. They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they cast out their sorrows.</P
><P
>4. Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; they go forth, and return not unto them.</P
><P
>5. Who hath sent out the wild ass free?  or who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass?</P
><P
>6. Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land his dwellings.</P
><P
>7. He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he the crying of the driver.</P
><P
>8. The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth after every green thing.</P
><P
>9. Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?</P
><P
>10. Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow?  or will he harrow the valleys after thee?</P
><P
>11. Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great?  or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?</P
><P
>12. Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather it into thy barn?</P
><P
>13. Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?  or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?</P
><P
>14. Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,</P
><P
>15. And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.</P
><P
>16. She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were not hers: her labour is in vain without fear;</P
><P
>17. Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.</P
><P
>18. What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horse and his rider.</P
><P
>19. Hast thou given the horse strength?  hast thou clothed his neck with thunder?</P
><P
>20. Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper?  the glory of his nostrils is terrible.</P
><P
>21. He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goeth on to meet the armed men.</P
><P
>22. He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he back from the sword.</P
><P
>23. The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the shield.</P
><P
>24. He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.</P
><P
>25. He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.</P
><P
>26. Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward the south?</P
><P
>27. Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on high?</P
><P
>28. She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the rock, and the strong place.</P
><P
>29. From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.</P
><P
>30. Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are, there is she.</P
