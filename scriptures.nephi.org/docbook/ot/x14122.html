>18.14. Chapter 14</H1
><P
>1. MAN that is born of a woman is of few days, and full of trouble.</P
><P
>2. He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also as a shadow, and continueth not.</P
><P
>3. And dost thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest me into judgment with thee?</P
><P
>4. Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?  not one.</P
><P
>5. Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;</P
><P
>6. Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling, his day.</P
><P
>7. For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.</P
><P
>8. Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock thereof die in the ground;</P
><P
>9. Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.</P
><P
>10. But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?</P
><P
>11. As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and drieth up:</P
><P
>12. So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.</P
><P
>13. O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint me a set time, and remember me!</P
><P
>14. If a man die, shall he live again?  all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.</P
><P
>15. Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands.</P
><P
>16. For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my sin?</P
><P
>17. My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up mine iniquity.</P
><P
>18. And surely the mountain falling cometh to nought, and the rock is removed out of his place.</P
><P
>19. The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope of man.</P
><P
>20. Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</P
><P
>21. His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.</P
><P
>22. But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within him shall mourn.</P
