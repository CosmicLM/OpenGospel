>20.15. Chapter 15</H1
><P
>1. A SOFT answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up anger.</P
><P
>2. The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness.</P
><P
>3. The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.</P
><P
>4. A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit.</P
><P
>5. A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that regardeth reproof is prudent.</P
><P
>6. In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the revenues of the wicked is trouble.</P
><P
>7. The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the foolish doeth not so.</P
><P
>8. The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but the prayer of the upright is his delight.</P
><P
>9. The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.</P
><P
>10. Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he that hateth reproof shall die.</P
><P
>11. Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then the hearts of the children of men?</P
><P
>12. A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he go unto the wise.</P
><P
>13. A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.</P
><P
>14. The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge: but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.</P
><P
>15. All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a merry heart hath a continual feast.</P
><P
>16. Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.</P
><P
>17. Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.</P
><P
>18. A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to anger appeaseth strife.</P
><P
>19. The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the way of the righteous is made plain.</P
><P
>20. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth his mother.</P
><P
>21. Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of understanding walketh uprightly.</P
><P
>22. Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the multitude of counsellors they are established.</P
><P
>23. A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken in due season, how good is it!</P
><P
>24. The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.</P
><P
>25. The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will establish the border of the widow.</P
><P
>26. The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but the words of the pure are pleasant words.</P
><P
>27. He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.</P
><P
>28. The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth of the wicked poureth out evil things.</P
><P
>29. The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of the righteous.</P
><P
>30. The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report maketh the bones fat.</P
><P
>31. The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.</P
><P
>32. He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he that heareth reproof getteth understanding.</P
><P
>33. The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.</P
