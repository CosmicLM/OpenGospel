>25.5. Chapter 5</H1
><P
>1. REMEMBER, O LORD, what is come upon us: consider, and behold our reproach.</P
><P
>2. Our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to aliens.</P
><P
>3. We are orphans and fatherless, our mothers are as widows.</P
><P
>4. We have drunken our water for money; our wood is sold unto us.</P
><P
>5. Our necks are under persecution: we labour, and have no rest.</P
><P
>6. We have given the hand to the Egyptians, and to the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</P
><P
>7. Our fathers have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities.</P
><P
>8. Servants have ruled over us: there is none that doth deliver us out of their hand.</P
><P
>9. We gat our bread with the peril of our lives because of the sword of the wilderness.</P
><P
>10. Our skin was black like an oven because of the terrible famine.</P
><P
>11. They ravished the women in Zion, and the maids in the cities of Judah.</P
><P
>12. Princes are hanged up by their hand: the faces of elders were not honoured.</P
><P
>13. They took the young men to grind, and the children fell under the wood.</P
><P
>14. The elders have ceased from the gate, the young men from their musick.</P
><P
>15. The joy of our heart is ceased; our dance is turned into mourning.</P
><P
>16. The crown is fallen from our head: woe unto us, that we have sinned!</P
><P
>17. For this our heart is faint; for these things our eyes are dim.</P
><P
>18. Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk upon it.</P
><P
>19. Thou, O LORD, remainest for ever; thy throne from generation to generation.</P
><P
>20. Wherefore dost thou forget us for ever, and forsake us so long time?</P
><P
>21. Turn thou us unto thee, O LORD, and we shall be turned; renew our days as of old.</P
><P
>22. But thou hast utterly rejected us; thou art very wroth against us.</P
