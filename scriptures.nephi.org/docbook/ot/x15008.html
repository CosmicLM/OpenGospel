>19.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:</P
><P
>2. Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</P
><P
>3. O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;</P
><P
>4. If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)</P
><P
>5. Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.  Selah.</P
><P
>6. Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded.</P
><P
>7. So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.</P
><P
>8. The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.</P
><P
>9. Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.</P
><P
>10. My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.</P
><P
>11. God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day.</P
><P
>12. If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</P
><P
>13. He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.</P
><P
>14. Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</P
><P
>15. He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch which he made.</P
><P
>16. His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.</P
><P
>17. I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.</P
