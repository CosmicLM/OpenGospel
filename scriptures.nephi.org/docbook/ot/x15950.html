>1. TRULY my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.</P
><P
>2. He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.</P
><P
>3. How long will ye imagine mischief against a man?  ye shall be slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence.</P
><P
>4. They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.  Selah.</P
><P
>5. My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.</P
><P
>6. He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall not be moved.</P
><P
>7. In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.</P
><P
>8. Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us.  Selah.</P
><P
>9. Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity.</P
><P
>10. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart upon them.</P
><P
>11. God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.</P
><P
>12. Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.</P
