>23.13. Chapter 13</H1
><P
>1. THE burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.</P
><P
>2. Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of the nobles.</P
><P
>3. I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my highness.</P
><P
>4. The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.</P
><P
>5. They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole land.</P
><P
>6. ¶ Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.</P
><P
>7. Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart shall melt:</P
><P
>8. And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as flames.</P
><P
>9. Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy the sinners thereof out of it.</P
><P
>10. For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.</P
><P
>11. And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.</P
><P
>12. I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man than the golden wedge of Ophir.</P
><P
>13. Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger.</P
><P
>14. And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and flee every one into his own land.</P
><P
>15. Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.</P
><P
>16. Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.</P
><P
>17. Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.</P
><P
>18. Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eye shall not spare children.</P
><P
>19. ¶ And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</P
><P
>20. It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.</P
><P
>21. But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.</P
><P
>22. And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.</P
