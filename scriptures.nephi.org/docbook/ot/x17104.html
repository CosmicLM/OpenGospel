><P
>1. O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy endureth for ever.</P
><P
>2. Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</P
><P
>3. Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</P
><P
>4. Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.</P
><P
>5. I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and set me in a large place.</P
><P
>6. The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto me?</P
><P
>7. The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.</P
><P
>8. It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.</P
><P
>9. It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.</P
><P
>10. All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD will I destroy them.</P
><P
>11. They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</P
><P
>12. They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.</P
><P
>13. Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD helped me.</P
><P
>14. The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.</P
><P
>15. The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</P
><P
>16. The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.</P
><P
>17. I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.</P
><P
>18. The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over unto death.</P
><P
>19. Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, and I will praise the LORD:</P
><P
>20. This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.</P
><P
>21. I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation.</P
><P
>22. The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.</P
><P
>23. This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.</P
><P
>24. This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</P
><P
>25. Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send now prosperity.</P
><P
>26. Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have blessed you out of the house of the LORD.</P
><P
>27. God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.</P
><P
>28. Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I will exalt thee.</P
><P
>29. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy endureth for ever.</P
