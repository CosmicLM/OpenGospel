><P
>1. I SAID, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.</P
><P
>2. I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.</P
><P
>3. My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned: then spake I with my tongue,</P
><P
>4. LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am.</P
><P
>5. Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity.  Selah.</P
><P
>6. Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shall gather them.</P
><P
>7. And now, Lord, what wait I for?  my hope is in thee.</P
><P
>8. Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproach of the foolish.</P
><P
>9. I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.</P
><P
>10. Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of thine hand.</P
><P
>11. When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man is vanity.  Selah.</P
><P
>12. Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were.</P
><P
>13. O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.</P
