>19.44. Chapter 44</H1
><P
>1. WE have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.</P
><P
>2. How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.</P
><P
>3. For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them.</P
><P
>4. Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.</P
><P
>5. Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name will we tread them under that rise up against us.</P
><P
>6. For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.</P
><P
>7. But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us.</P
><P
>8. In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.  Selah.</P
><P
>9. But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies.</P
><P
>10. Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hate us spoil for themselves.</P
><P
>11. Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast scattered us among the heathen.</P
><P
>12. Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy wealth by their price.</P
><P
>13. Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a derision to them that are round about us.</P
><P
>14. Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the head among the people.</P
><P
>15. My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my face hath covered me,</P
><P
>16. For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger.</P
><P
>17. All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.</P
><P
>18. Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined from thy way;</P
><P
>19. Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and covered us with the shadow of death.</P
><P
>20. If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god;</P
><P
>21. Shall not God search this out?  for he knoweth the secrets of the heart.</P
><P
>22. Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter.</P
><P
>23. Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord?  arise, cast us not off for ever.</P
><P
>24. Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?</P
><P
>25. For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth unto the earth.</P
><P
>26. Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.</P
