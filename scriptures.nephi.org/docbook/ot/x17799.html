>20.4. Chapter 4</H1
><P
>1. HEAR, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.</P
><P
>2. For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</P
><P
>3. For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</P
><P
>4. He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.</P
><P
>5. Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.</P
><P
>6. Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.</P
><P
>7. Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.</P
><P
>8. Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.</P
><P
>9. She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.</P
><P
>10. Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.</P
><P
>11. I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.</P
><P
>12. When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</P
><P
>13. Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.</P
><P
>14. ¶ Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.</P
><P
>15. Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</P
><P
>16. For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</P
><P
>17. For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.</P
><P
>18. But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</P
><P
>19. The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.</P
><P
>20. ¶ My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</P
><P
>21. Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.</P
><P
>22. For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.</P
><P
>23. ¶ Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.</P
><P
>24. Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.</P
><P
>25. Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.</P
><P
>26. Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</P
><P
>27. Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.</P
