>20.8. Chapter 8</H1
><P
>1. DOTH not wisdom cry?  and understanding put forth her voice?</P
><P
>2. She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places of the paths.</P
><P
>3. She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors.</P
><P
>4. Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.</P
><P
>5. O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an understanding heart.</P
><P
>6. Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.</P
><P
>7. For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.</P
><P
>8. All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing froward or perverse in them.</P
><P
>9. They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.</P
><P
>10. Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.</P
><P
>11. For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to it.</P
><P
>12. I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty inventions.</P
><P
>13. The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.</P
><P
>14. Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.</P
><P
>15. By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.</P
><P
>16. By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</P
><P
>17. I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me.</P
><P
>18. Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.</P
><P
>19. My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice silver.</P
><P
>20. I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:</P
><P
>21. That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.</P
><P
>22. The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.</P
><P
>23. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.</P
><P
>24. When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.</P
><P
>25. Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:</P
><P
>26. While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the world.</P
><P
>27. When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:</P
><P
>28. When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:</P
><P
>29. When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:</P
><P
>30. Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;</P
><P
>31. Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.</P
><P
>32. Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.</P
><P
>33. Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.</P
><P
>34. Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.</P
><P
>35. For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the LORD.</P
><P
>36. But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.</P
