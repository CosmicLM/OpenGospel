><P
>1. AND he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to resist him.</P
><P
>2. And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan; even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?</P
><P
>3. Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before the angel.</P
><P
>4. And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy garments from him.  And unto him he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.</P
><P
>5. And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head.  So they set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.  And the angel of the LORD stood by.</P
><P
>6. And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,</P
><P
>7. Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways, and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee places to walk among these that stand by.</P
><P
>8. Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.</P
><P
>9. For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.</P
><P
>10. In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.</P
