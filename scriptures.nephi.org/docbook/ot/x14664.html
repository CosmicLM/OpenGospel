>18.34. Chapter 34</H1
><P
>1. FURTHERMORE Elihu answered and said,</P
><P
>2. Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.</P
><P
>3. For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.</P
><P
>4. Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what is good.</P
><P
>5. For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my judgment.</P
><P
>6. Should I lie against my right?  my wound is incurable without transgression.</P
><P
>7. What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?</P
><P
>8. Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh with wicked men.</P
><P
>9. For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should delight himself with God.</P
><P
>10. Therefore hearken unto me, ye men of understanding: far be it from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that he should commit iniquity.</P
><P
>11. For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause every man to find according to his ways.</P
><P
>12. Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almighty pervert judgment.</P
><P
>13. Who hath given him a charge over the earth?  or who hath disposed the whole world?</P
><P
>14. If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his spirit and his breath;</P
><P
>15. All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto dust.</P
><P
>16. If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voice of my words.</P
><P
>17. Shall even he that hateth right govern?  and wilt thou condemn him that is most just?</P
><P
>18. Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked?  and to princes, Ye are ungodly?</P
><P
>19. How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor?  for they all are the work of his hands.</P
><P
>20. In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away without hand.</P
><P
>21. For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.</P
><P
>22. There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.</P
><P
>23. For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should enter into judgment with God.</P
><P
>24. He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set others in their stead.</P
><P
>25. Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in the night, so that they are destroyed.</P
><P
>26. He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;</P
><P
>27. Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any of his ways:</P
><P
>28. So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.</P
><P
>29. When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble?  and when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?  whether it be done against a nation, or against a man only:</P
><P
>30. That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.</P
><P
>31. Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne chastisement, I will not offend any more:</P
><P
>32. That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</P
><P
>33. Should it be according to thy mind?  he will recompense it, whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: therefore speak what thou knowest.</P
><P
>34. Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken unto me.</P
><P
>35. Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without wisdom.</P
><P
>36. My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his answers for wicked men.</P
><P
>37. For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands among us, and multiplieth his words against God.</P
