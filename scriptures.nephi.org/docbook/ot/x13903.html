>18.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. BUT Job answered and said,</P
><P
>2. Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!</P
><P
>3. For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words are swallowed up.</P
><P
>4. For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</P
><P
>5. Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass?  or loweth the ox over his fodder?</P
><P
>6. Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt?  or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</P
><P
>7. The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.</P
><P
>8. Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me the thing that I long for!</P
><P
>9. Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</P
><P
>10. Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.</P
><P
>11. What is my strength, that I should hope?  and what is mine end, that I should prolong my life?</P
><P
>12. Is my strength the strength of stones?  or is my flesh of brass?</P
><P
>13. Is not my help in me?  and is wisdom driven quite from me?</P
><P
>14. To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</P
><P
>15. My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the stream of brooks they pass away;</P
><P
>16. Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow is hid:</P
><P
>17. What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</P
><P
>18. The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, and perish.</P
><P
>19. The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for them.</P
><P
>20. They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.</P
><P
>21. For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.</P
><P
>22. Did I say, Bring unto me?  or, Give a reward for me of your substance?</P
><P
>23. Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand?  or, Redeem me from the hand of the mighty?</P
><P
>24. Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</P
><P
>25. How forcible are right words!  but what doth your arguing reprove?</P
><P
>26. Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that is desperate, which are as wind?</P
><P
>27. Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your friend.</P
><P
>28. Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto you if I lie.</P
><P
>29. Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, my righteousness is in it.</P
><P
>30. Is there iniquity in my tongue?  cannot my taste discern perverse things?</P
