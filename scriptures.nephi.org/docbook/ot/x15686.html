>19.45. Chapter 45</H1
><P
>1. MY heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.</P
><P
>2. Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.</P
><P
>3. Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty.</P
><P
>4. And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things.</P
><P
>5. Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee.</P
><P
>6. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy kingdom is a right sceptre.</P
><P
>7. Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.</P
><P
>8. All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.</P
><P
>9. Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.</P
><P
>10. Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;</P
><P
>11. So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him.</P
><P
>12. And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.</P
><P
>13. The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of wrought gold.</P
><P
>14. She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.</P
><P
>15. With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall enter into the king's palace.</P
><P
>16. Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth.</P
><P
>17. I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations: therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.</P
