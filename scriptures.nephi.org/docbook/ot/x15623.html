>1. BLESSED is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.</P
><P
>2. The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies.</P
><P
>3. The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou wilt make all his bed in his sickness.</P
><P
>4. I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.</P
><P
>5. Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?</P
><P
>6. And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.</P
><P
>7. All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do they devise my hurt.</P
><P
>8. An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and nowthat he lieth he shall rise up no more.</P
><P
>9. Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.</P
><P
>10. But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.</P
><P
>11. By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.</P
><P
>12. And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.</P
><P
>13. Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting.  Amen, and Amen.</P
