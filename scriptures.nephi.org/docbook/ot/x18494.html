>20.26. Chapter 26</H1
><P
>1. AS snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not seemly for a fool.</P
><P
>2. As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the curse causeless shall not come.</P
><P
>3. A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the fool's back.</P
><P
>4. Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be like unto him.</P
><P
>5. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own conceit.</P
><P
>6. He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off the feet, and drinketh damage.</P
><P
>7. The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</P
><P
>8. As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth honour to a fool.</P
><P
>9. As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a parable in the mouth of fools.</P
><P
>10. The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth transgressors.</P
><P
>11. As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his folly.</P
><P
>12. Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit?  there is more hope of a fool than of him.</P
><P
>13. The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is in the streets.</P
><P
>14. As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon his bed.</P
><P
>15. The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth.</P
><P
>16. The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that can render a reason.</P
><P
>17. He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.</P
><P
>18. As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,</P
><P
>19. So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?</P
><P
>20. Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.</P
><P
>21. As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a contentious man to kindle strife.</P
><P
>22. The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</P
><P
>23. Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered with silver dross.</P
><P
>24. He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him;</P
><P
>25. When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.</P
><P
>26. Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be shewed before the whole congregation.</P
><P
>27. Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a stone, it will return upon him.</P
><P
>28. A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a flattering mouth worketh ruin.</P
