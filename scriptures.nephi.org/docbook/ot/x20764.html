>24.10. Chapter 10</H1
><P
>1. HEAR ye the word which the LORD speaketh unto you, O house of Israel:</P
><P
>2. Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them.</P
><P
>3. For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the axe.</P
><P
>4. They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it move not.</P
><P
>5. They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go.  Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.</P
><P
>6. Forasmuch as there is none like unto thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might.</P
><P
>7. Who would not fear thee, O King of nations?  for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</P
><P
>8. But they are altogether brutish and foolish: the stock is a doctrine of vanities.</P
><P
>9. Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz, the work of the workman, and of the hands of the founder: blue and purple is their clothing: they are all the work of cunning men.</P
><P
>10. But the LORD is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlasting king: at his wrath the earth shall tremble, and the nations shall not be able to abide his indignation.</P
><P
>11. Thus shall ye say unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from under these heavens.</P
><P
>12. He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by his discretion.</P
><P
>13. When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures.</P
><P
>14. Every man is brutish in his knowledge: every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</P
><P
>15. They are vanity, and the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish.</P
><P
>16. The portion of Jacob is not like them: for he is the former of all things; and Israel is the rod of his inheritance: The LORD of hosts is his name.</P
><P
>17. ¶ Gather up thy wares out of the land, O inhabitant of the fortress.</P
><P
>18. For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will sling out the inhabitants of the land at this once, and will distress them, that they may find it so.</P
><P
>19. ¶ Woe is me for my hurt!  my wound is grievous: but I said, Truly this is a grief, and I must bear it.</P
><P
>20. My tabernacle is spoiled, and all my cords are broken: my children are gone forth of me, and they are not: there is none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my curtains.</P
><P
>21. For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.</P
><P
>22. Behold, the noise of the bruit is come, and a great commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah desolate, and a den of dragons.</P
><P
>23. ¶ O LORD, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps.</P
><P
>24. O LORD, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</P
><P
>25. Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: for they have eaten up Jacob, and devoured him, and consumed him, and have made his habitation desolate.</P
