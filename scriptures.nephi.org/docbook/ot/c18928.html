><P
>1. THE song of songs, which is Solomon's.</P
><P
>2. Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is better than wine.</P
><P
>3. Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.</P
><P
>4. Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.</P
><P
>5. I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.</P
><P
>6. Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</P
><P
>7. Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</P
><P
>8. ¶ If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</P
><P
>9. I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.</P
><P
>10. Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with chains of gold.</P
><P
>11. We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.</P
><P
>12. ¶ While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth forth the smell thereof.</P
><P
>13. A bundle of myrrh is my wellbeloved unto me; he shall lie all night betwixt my breasts.</P
><P
>14. My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the vineyards of En-gedi.</P
><P
>15. Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes.</P
><P
>16. Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed is green.</P
><P
>17. The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.</P
