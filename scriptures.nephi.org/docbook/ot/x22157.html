>26.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. AND he said unto me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak unto thee.</P
><P
>2. And the spirit entered into me when he spake unto me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spake unto me.</P
><P
>3. And he said unto me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even unto this very day.</P
><P
>4. For they are impudent children and stiffhearted.  I do send thee unto them; and thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD.</P
><P
>5. And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</P
><P
>6. ¶ And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</P
><P
>7. And thou shalt speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.</P
><P
>8. But thou, son of man, hear what I say unto thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that I give thee.</P
><P
>9. ¶ And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent unto me; and, lo, a roll of a book was therein;</P
><P
>10. And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</P
