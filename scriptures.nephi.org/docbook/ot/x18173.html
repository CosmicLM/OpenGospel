>20.16. Chapter 16</H1
><P
>1. THE preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the LORD.</P
><P
>2. All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD weigheth the spirits.</P
><P
>3. Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.</P
><P
>4. The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the wicked for the day of evil.</P
><P
>5. Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.</P
><P
>6. By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the LORD men depart from evil.</P
><P
>7. When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</P
><P
>8. Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues without right.</P
><P
>9. A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his steps.</P
><P
>10. A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth transgresseth not in judgment.</P
><P
>11. A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of the bag are his work.</P
><P
>12. It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the throne is established by righteousness.</P
><P
>13. Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him that speaketh right.</P
><P
>14. The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man will pacify it.</P
><P
>15. In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour is as a cloud of the latter rain.</P
><P
>16. How much better is it to get wisdom than gold!  and to get understanding rather to be chosen than silver!</P
><P
>17. The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that keepeth his way preserveth his soul.</P
><P
>18. Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a fall.</P
><P
>19. Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to divide the spoil with the proud.</P
><P
>20. He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.</P
><P
>21. The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness of the lips increaseth learning.</P
><P
>22. Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it: but the instruction of fools is folly.</P
><P
>23. The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning to his lips.</P
><P
>24. Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and health to the bones.</P
><P
>25. There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</P
><P
>26. He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth it of him.</P
><P
>27. An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a burning fire.</P
><P
>28. A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief friends.</P
><P
>29. A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the way that is not good.</P
><P
>30. He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips he bringeth evil to pass.</P
><P
>31. The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way of righteousness.</P
><P
>32. He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.</P
><P
>33. The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof is of the LORD.</P
