><P
>1. NOT unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.</P
><P
>2. Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?</P
><P
>3. But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath pleased.</P
><P
>4. Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.</P
><P
>5. They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they see not:</P
><P
>6. They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they smell not:</P
><P
>7. They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they walk not: neither speak they through their throat.</P
><P
>8. They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.</P
><P
>9. O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</P
><P
>10. O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</P
><P
>11. Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and their shield.</P
><P
>12. The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.</P
><P
>13. He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.</P
><P
>14. The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.</P
><P
>15. Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.</P
><P
>16. The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth hath he given to the children of men.</P
><P
>17. The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.</P
><P
>18. But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore.  Praise the LORD.</P
