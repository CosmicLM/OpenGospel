>19.69. Chapter 69</H1
><P
>1. SAVE me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.</P
><P
>2. I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.</P
><P
>3. I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail while I wait for my God.</P
><P
>4. They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not away.</P
><P
>5. O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid from thee.</P
><P
>6. Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.</P
><P
>7. Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face.</P
><P
>8. I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my mother's children.</P
><P
>9. For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.</P
><P
>10. When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach.</P
><P
>11. I made sackcloth also my garment; and I become a proverb to them.</P
><P
>12. They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards.</P
><P
>13. But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth of thy salvation.</P
><P
>14. Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.</P
><P
>15. Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.</P
><P
>16. Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.</P
><P
>17. And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble: hear me speedily.</P
><P
>18. Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of mine enemies.</P
><P
>19. Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour: mine adversaries are all before thee.</P
><P
>20. Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.</P
><P
>21. They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.</P
><P
>22. Let their table become a snare before them: and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.</P
><P
>23. Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their loins continually to shake.</P
><P
>24. Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful anger take hold of them.</P
><P
>25. Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their tents.</P
><P
>26. For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.</P
><P
>27. Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thy righteousness.</P
><P
>28. Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be written with the righteous.</P
><P
>29. But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me up on high.</P
><P
>30. I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify him with thanksgiving.</P
><P
>31. This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs.</P
><P
>32. The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall live that seek God.</P
><P
>33. For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.</P
><P
>34. Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and everything that moveth therein.</P
><P
>35. For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.</P
><P
>36. The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that love his name shall dwell therein.</P
