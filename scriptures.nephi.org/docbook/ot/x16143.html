>19.72. Chapter 72</H1
><P
>1. GIVE the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.</P
><P
>2. He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.</P
><P
>3. The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.</P
><P
>4. He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.</P
><P
>5. They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.</P
><P
>6. He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers that water the earth.</P
><P
>7. In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.</P
><P
>8. He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.</P
><P
>9. They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.</P
><P
>10. The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.</P
><P
>11. Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall serve him.</P
><P
>12. For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.</P
><P
>13. He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.</P
><P
>14. He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and precious shall their blood be in his sight.</P
><P
>15. And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shall he be praised.</P
><P
>16. There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.</P
><P
>17. His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.</P
><P
>18. Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.</P
><P
>19. And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.</P
><P
>20. The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.</P
