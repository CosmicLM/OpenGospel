><P
>1. PRAISE ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.</P
><P
>2. The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the outcasts of Israel.</P
><P
>3. He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.</P
><P
>4. He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.</P
><P
>5. Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is infinite.</P
><P
>6. The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to the ground.</P
><P
>7. Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God:</P
><P
>8. Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.</P
><P
>9. He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.</P
><P
>10. He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not pleasure in the legs of a man.</P
><P
>11. The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.</P
><P
>12. Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.</P
><P
>13. For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.</P
><P
>14. He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.</P
><P
>15. He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly.</P
><P
>16. He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like ashes.</P
><P
>17. He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?</P
><P
>18. He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind to blow, and the waters flow.</P
><P
>19. He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.</P
><P
>20. He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his judgments, they have not known them.  Praise ye the LORD.</P
