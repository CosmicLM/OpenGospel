>1. THE proverbs of Solomon.  A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.</P
><P
>2. Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.</P
><P
>3. The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.</P
><P
>4. He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.</P
><P
>5. He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.</P
><P
>6. Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</P
><P
>7. The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.</P
><P
>8. The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.</P
><P
>9. He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.</P
><P
>10. He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.</P
><P
>11. The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence covereth the mouth of the wicked.</P
><P
>12. Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.</P
><P
>13. In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: but a rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.</P
><P
>14. Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is near destruction.</P
><P
>15. The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of the poor is their poverty.</P
><P
>16. The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the wicked to sin.</P
><P
>17. He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that refuseth reproof erreth.</P
><P
>18. He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.</P
><P
>19. In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that refraineth his lips is wise.</P
><P
>20. The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the wicked is little worth.</P
><P
>21. The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of wisdom.</P
><P
>22. The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.</P
><P
>23. It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of understanding hath wisdom.</P
><P
>24. The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire of the righteous shall be granted.</P
><P
>25. As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.</P
><P
>26. As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.</P
><P
>27. The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the wicked shall be shortened.</P
><P
>28. The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectation of the wicked shall perish.</P
><P
>29. The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.</P
><P
>30. The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not inhabit the earth.</P
><P
>31. The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward tongue shall be cut out.</P
><P
>32. The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.</P
