>19.105. Chapter 105</H1
><P
>1. O GIVE thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known his deeds among the people.</P
><P
>2. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrous works.</P
><P
>3. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the LORD.</P
><P
>4. Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.</P
><P
>5. Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;</P
><P
>6. O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his chosen.</P
><P
>7. He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.</P
><P
>8. He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations.</P
><P
>9. Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;</P
><P
>10. And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant:</P
><P
>11. Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:</P
><P
>12. When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.</P
><P
>13. When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;</P
><P
>14. He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;</P
><P
>15. Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.</P
><P
>16. Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.</P
><P
>17. He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:</P
><P
>18. Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:</P
><P
>19. Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.</P
><P
>20. The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, and let him go free.</P
><P
>21. He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:</P
><P
>22. To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.</P
><P
>23. Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</P
><P
>24. And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.</P
><P
>25. He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly with his servants.</P
><P
>26. He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.</P
><P
>27. They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.</P
><P
>28. He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.</P
><P
>29. He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.</P
><P
>30. Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.</P
><P
>31. He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in all their coasts.</P
><P
>32. He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.</P
><P
>33. He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.</P
><P
>34. He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that without number,</P
><P
>35. And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground.</P
><P
>36. He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of all their strength.</P
><P
>37. He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was not one feeble person among their tribes.</P
><P
>38. Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell upon them.</P
><P
>39. He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in the night.</P
><P
>40. The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</P
><P
>41. He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the dry places like a river.</P
><P
>42. For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.</P
><P
>43. And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness:</P
><P
>44. And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the labour of the people;</P
><P
>45. That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.  Praise ye the LORD.</P
