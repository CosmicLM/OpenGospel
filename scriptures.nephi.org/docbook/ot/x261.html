>1.10. Chapter 10</H1
><P
>1. NOW these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.</P
><P
>2. The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan, and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</P
><P
>3. And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</P
><P
>4. And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.</P
><P
>5. By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.</P
><P
>6. ¶ And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.</P
><P
>7. And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and Raamah, and Sabtecha: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and Dedan.</P
><P
>8. And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.</P
><P
>9. He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.</P
><P
>10. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</P
><P
>11. Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah,</P
><P
>12. And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.</P
><P
>13. And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and Naphtuhim,</P
><P
>14. And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and Caphtorim.</P
><P
>15. ¶ And Canaan begat Sidon his firstborn, and Heth,</P
><P
>16. And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,</P
><P
>17. And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,</P
><P
>18. And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.</P
><P
>19. And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.</P
><P
>20. These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.</P
><P
>21. ¶ Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.</P
><P
>22. The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud, and Aram.</P
><P
>23. And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.</P
><P
>24. And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.</P
><P
>25. And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg; for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name was Joktan.</P
><P
>26. And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and Jerah,</P
><P
>27. And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,</P
><P
>28. And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,</P
><P
>29. And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of Joktan.</P
><P
>30. And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a mount of the east.</P
><P
>31. These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</P
><P
>32. These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</P
