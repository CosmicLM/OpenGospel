>20.2. Chapter 2</H1
><P
>1. MY son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;</P
><P
>2. So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;</P
><P
>3. Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice for understanding;</P
><P
>4. If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;</P
><P
>5. Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</P
><P
>6. For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and understanding.</P
><P
>7. He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.</P
><P
>8. He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.</P
><P
>9. Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.</P
><P
>10. ¶ When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul;</P
><P
>11. Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:</P
><P
>12. To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speaketh froward things;</P
><P
>13. Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;</P
><P
>14. Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;</P
><P
>15. Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:</P
><P
>16. To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with her words;</P
><P
>17. Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.</P
><P
>18. For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</P
><P
>19. None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the paths of life.</P
><P
>20. That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</P
><P
>21. For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it.</P
><P
>22. But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</P
