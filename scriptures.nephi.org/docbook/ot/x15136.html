>19.17. Chapter 17</H1
><P
>1. HEAR the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.</P
><P
>2. Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes behold the things that are equal.</P
><P
>3. Thou has proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night; thou has tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.</P
><P
>4. Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.</P
><P
>5. Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.</P
><P
>6. I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.</P
><P
>7. Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them.</P
><P
>8. Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,</P
><P
>9. From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about.</P
><P
>10. They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speak proudly.</P
><P
>11. They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth;</P
><P
>12. Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a young lion lurking in secret places.</P
><P
>13. Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword:</P
><P
>14. From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes.</P
><P
>15. As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.</P
