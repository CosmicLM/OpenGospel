>18.11. Chapter 11</H1
><P
>1. THEN answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,</P
><P
>2. Should not the multitude of words be answered?  and should a man full of talk be justified?</P
><P
>3. Should thy lies make men hold their peace?  and when thou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?</P
><P
>4. For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.</P
><P
>5. But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;</P
><P
>6. And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they are double to that which is!  Know therefore that God exacteth of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.</P
><P
>7. Canst thou by searching find out God?  canst thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?</P
><P
>8. It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do?  deeper than hell; what canst thou know?</P
><P
>9. The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.</P
><P
>10. If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him?</P
><P
>11. For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not then consider it?</P
><P
>12. For vain man would be wise, though man be born like a wild ass's colt.</P
><P
>13. If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands toward him;</P
><P
>14. If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.</P
><P
>15. For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:</P
><P
>16. Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away:</P
><P
>17. And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday; thou shalt shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.</P
><P
>18. And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.</P
><P
>19. Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea, many shall make suit unto thee.</P
><P
>20. But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.</P
