><P
>1. MOREOVER the LORD answered Job, and said,</P
><P
>2. Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him?  he that reproveth God, let him answer it.</P
><P
>3. ¶ Then Job answered the LORD, and said,</P
><P
>4. Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee?  I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.</P
><P
>5. Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I will proceed no further.</P
><P
>6. ¶ Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</P
><P
>7. Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</P
><P
>8. Wilt thou also disannul my judgment?  wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?</P
><P
>9. Hast thou an arm like God?  or canst thou thunder with a voice like him?</P
><P
>10. Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.</P
><P
>11. Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.</P
><P
>12. Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.</P
><P
>13. Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.</P
><P
>14. Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand can save thee.</P
><P
>15. ¶ Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.</P
><P
>16. Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.</P
><P
>17. He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are wrapped together.</P
><P
>18. His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.</P
><P
>19. He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach unto him.</P
><P
>20. Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.</P
><P
>21. He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.</P
><P
>22. The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook compass him about.</P
><P
>23. Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.</P
><P
>24. He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.</P
