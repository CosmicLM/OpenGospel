>20.7. Chapter 7</H1
><P
>1. MY son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.</P
><P
>2. Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.</P
><P
>3. Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.</P
><P
>4. Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:</P
><P
>5. That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger which flattereth with her words.</P
><P
>6. ¶ For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,</P
><P
>7. And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,</P
><P
>8. Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,</P
><P
>9. In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:</P
><P
>10. And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.</P
><P
>11. (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:</P
><P
>12. Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)</P
><P
>13. So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,</P
><P
>14. I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.</P
><P
>15. Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and I have found thee.</P
><P
>16. I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.</P
><P
>17. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.</P
><P
>18. Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us solace ourselves with loves.</P
><P
>19. For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:</P
><P
>20. He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.</P
><P
>21. With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.</P
><P
>22. He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;</P
><P
>23. Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.</P
><P
>24. ¶ Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.</P
><P
>25. Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.</P
><P
>26. For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.</P
><P
>27. Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death.</P
