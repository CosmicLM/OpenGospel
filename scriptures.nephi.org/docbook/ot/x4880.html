>1. AND the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</P
><P
>2. Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in their due season.</P
><P
>3. And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt offering.</P
><P
>4. The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even;</P
><P
>5. And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.</P
><P
>6. It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.</P
><P
>7. And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.</P
><P
>8. And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</P
><P
>9. ¶ And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:</P
><P
>10. This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</P
><P
>11. ¶ And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven lambs of the first year without spot;</P
><P
>12. And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;</P
><P
>13. And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.</P
><P
>14. And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year.</P
><P
>15. And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</P
><P
>16. And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover of the LORD.</P
><P
>17. And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.</P
><P
>18. In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no manner of servile work therein:</P
><P
>19. But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without blemish:</P
><P
>20. And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil: three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a ram;</P
><P
>21. A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb, throughout the seven lambs:</P
><P
>22. And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.</P
><P
>23. Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering.</P
><P
>24. After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.</P
><P
>25. And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.</P
><P
>26. ¶ Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:</P
><P
>27. But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the first year;</P
><P
>28. And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,</P
><P
>29. A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven lambs;</P
><P
>30. And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.</P
><P
>31. Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish) and their drink offerings.</P
