>18.38. Chapter 38</H1
><P
>1. THEN the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,</P
><P
>2. Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?</P
><P
>3. Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.</P
><P
>4. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?  declare, if thou hast understanding.</P
><P
>5. Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest?  or who hath stretched the line upon it?</P
><P
>6. Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened?  or who laid the corner stone thereof;</P
><P
>7. When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?</P
><P
>8. Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb?</P
><P
>9. When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it,</P
><P
>10. And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,</P
><P
>11. And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proud waves be stayed?</P
><P
>12. Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place;</P
><P
>13. That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shaken out of it?</P
><P
>14. It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.</P
><P
>15. And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high arm shall be broken.</P
><P
>16. Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea?  or hast thou walked in the search of the depth?</P
><P
>17. Have the gates of death been opened unto thee?  or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?</P
><P
>18. Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth?  declare if thou knowest it all.</P
><P
>19. Where is the way where light dwelleth?  and as for darkness, where is the place thereof,</P
><P
>20. That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?</P
><P
>21. Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born?  or because the number of thy days is great?</P
><P
>22. Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow?  or hast thou seen the treasures of the hail,</P
><P
>23. Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the day of battle and war?</P
><P
>24. By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?</P
><P
>25. Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for the lightning of thunder;</P
><P
>26. To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man;</P
><P
>27. To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herb to spring forth?</P
><P
>28. Hath the rain a father?  or who hath begotten the drops of dew?</P
><P
>29. Out of whose womb came the ice?  and the hoary frost of heaven, who hath gendered it?</P
><P
>30. The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.</P
><P
>31. Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?</P
><P
>32. Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?  or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?</P
><P
>33. Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven?  canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth?</P
><P
>34. Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of waters may cover thee?</P
><P
>35. Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?</P
><P
>36. Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts?  or who hath given understanding to the heart?</P
><P
>37. Who can number the clouds in wisdom?  or who can stay the bottles of heaven,</P
><P
>38. When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast together?</P
><P
>39. Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion?  or fill the appetite of the young lions,</P
><P
>40. When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?</P
><P
>41. Who provideth for the raven his food?  when his young ones cry unto God, they wander for lack of meat.</P
