><P
>1. DO ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation?  do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</P
><P
>2. Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.</P
><P
>3. The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies.</P
><P
>4. Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;</P
><P
>5. Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.</P
><P
>6. Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great teeth of the young lions, O LORD.</P
><P
>7. Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.</P
><P
>8. As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.</P
><P
>9. Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.</P
><P
>10. The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.</P
><P
>11. So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.</P
