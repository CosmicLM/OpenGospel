><P
>32. And they removed from Bene-jaakan, and encamped at Hor-hagidgad.</P
><P
>33. And they went from Hor-hagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.</P
><P
>34. And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.</P
><P
>35. And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Ezion-gaber.</P
><P
>36. And they removed from Ezion-gaber, and pitched in the wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.</P
><P
>37. And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the edge of the land of Edom.</P
><P
>38. And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the fifth month.</P
><P
>39. And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he died in mount Hor.</P

><P
>49. And they pitched by Jordan, from Beth-jesimoth even unto Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.</P
><P
>50. ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,</P
><P
>51. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;</P
><P
>52. Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high places:</P
><P
>53. And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.</P
><P
>54. And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit.</P
><P
>55. But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.</P
><P
>56. Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them.</P
