>18.36. Chapter 36</H1
><P
>1. ELIHU also proceeded, and said,</P
><P
>2. Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.</P
><P
>3. I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe righteousness to my Maker.</P
><P
>4. For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in knowledge is with thee.</P
><P
>5. Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in strength and wisdom.</P
><P
>6. He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to the poor.</P
><P
>7. He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and they are exalted.</P
><P
>8. And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of affliction;</P
><P
>9. Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that they have exceeded.</P
><P
>10. He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that they return from iniquity.</P
><P
>11. If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasures.</P
><P
>12. But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they shall die without knowledge.</P
><P
>13. But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when he bindeth them.</P
><P
>14. They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</P
><P
>15. He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their ears in oppression.</P
><P
>16. Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.</P
><P
>17. But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment and justice take hold on thee.</P
><P
>18. Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.</P
><P
>19. Will he esteem thy riches?  no, not gold, nor all the forces of strength.</P
><P
>20. Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.</P
><P
>21. Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen rather than affliction.</P
><P
>22. Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?</P
><P
>23. Who hath enjoined him his way?  or who can say, Thou hast wrought iniquity?</P
><P
>24. Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.</P
><P
>25. Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.</P
><P
>26. Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the number of his years be searched out.</P
><P
>27. For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain according to the vapour thereof:</P
><P
>28. Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.</P
><P
>29. Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the noise of his tabernacle?</P
><P
>30. Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the bottom of the sea.</P
><P
>31. For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.</P
><P
>32. With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.</P
><P
>33. The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also concerning the vapour.</P
