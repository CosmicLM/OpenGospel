><P
>1. UNTO thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.</P
><P
>2. Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.</P
><P
>3. Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts.</P
><P
>4. Give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert.</P
><P
>5. Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.</P
><P
>6. Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications.</P
><P
>7. The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him.</P
><P
>8. The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of his anointed.</P
><P
>9. Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, and lift them up for ever.</P
