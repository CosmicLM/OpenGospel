>1.15. Chapter 15</H1
><P
>1. AFTER these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.</P
><P
>2. And Abram said, Lord GOD, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?</P
><P
>3. And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.</P
><P
>4. And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</P
><P
>5. And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</P
><P
>6. And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.</P
><P
>7. And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</P
><P
>8. And he said, Lord GOD, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?</P
><P
>9. And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old, and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</P
><P
>10. And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided he not.</P
><P
>11. And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove them away.</P
><P
>12. And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</P
><P
>13. And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</P
><P
>14. And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and afterward shall they come out with great substance.</P
><P
>15. And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be buried in a good old age.</P
><P
>16. But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</P
><P
>17. And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed between those pieces.</P
><P
>18. In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying, Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates:</P
><P
>19. The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,</P
><P
>20. And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,</P
><P
>21. And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.</P
