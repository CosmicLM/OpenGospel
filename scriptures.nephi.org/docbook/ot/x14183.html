>18.16. Chapter 16</H1
><P
>1. THEN Job answered and said,</P
><P
>2. I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye all.</P
><P
>3. Shall vain words have an end?  or what emboldeneth thee that thou answerest?</P
><P
>4. I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head at you.</P
><P
>5. But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips should asswage your grief.</P
><P
>6. Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear, what am I eased?</P
><P
>7. But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my company.</P
><P
>8. And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.</P
><P
>9. He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.</P
><P
>10. They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves together against me.</P
><P
>11. God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into the hands of the wicked.</P
><P
>12. I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.</P
><P
>13. His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.</P
><P
>14. He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me like a giant.</P
><P
>15. I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in the dust.</P
><P
>16. My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow of death;</P
><P
>17. Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.</P
><P
>18. O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.</P
><P
>19. Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on high.</P
><P
>20. My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.</P
><P
>21. O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neighbour!</P
><P
>22. When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I shall not return.</P
