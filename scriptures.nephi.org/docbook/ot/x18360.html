>20.22. Chapter 22</H1
><P
>1. A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour rather than silver and gold.</P
><P
>2. The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them all.</P
><P
>3. A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the simple pass on, and are punished.</P
><P
>4. By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour, and life.</P
><P
>5. Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth keep his soul shall be far from them.</P
><P
>6. Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</P
><P
>7. The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.</P
><P
>8. He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his anger shall fail.</P
><P
>9. He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth of his bread to the poor.</P
><P
>10. Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife and reproach shall cease.</P
><P
>11. He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips the king shall be his friend.</P
><P
>12. The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth the words of the transgressor.</P
><P
>13. The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be slain in the streets.</P
><P
>14. The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred of the LORD shall fall therein.</P
><P
>15. Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction shall drive it far from him.</P
><P
>16. He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.</P
><P
>17. Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply thine heart unto my knowledge.</P
><P
>18. For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they shall withal be fitted in thy lips.</P
><P
>19. That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee this day, even to thee.</P
><P
>20. Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and knowledge,</P
><P
>21. That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them that send unto thee?</P
><P
>22. Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the afflicted in the gate:</P
><P
>23. For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of those that spoiled them.</P
><P
>24. Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man thou shalt not go:</P
><P
>25. Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.</P
><P
>26. Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts.</P
><P
>27. If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</P
><P
>28. Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.</P
><P
>29. Seest thou a man diligent in his business?  he shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.</P
