>19.102. Chapter 102</H1
><P
>1. HEAR my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.</P
><P
>2. Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble; incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.</P
><P
>3. For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth.</P
><P
>4. My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget to eat my bread.</P
><P
>5. By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin.</P
><P
>6. I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the desert.</P
><P
>7. I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.</P
><P
>8. Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad against me are sworn against me.</P
><P
>9. For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping,</P
><P
>10. Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down.</P
><P
>11. My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered like grass.</P
><P
>12. But thou, O LORD, shalt endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations.</P
><P
>13. Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come.</P
><P
>14. For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof.</P
><P
>15. So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the kings of the earth thy glory.</P
><P
>16. When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory.</P
><P
>17. He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise their prayer.</P
><P
>18. This shall be written for the generation to come: and the people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.</P
><P
>19. For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the LORD behold the earth;</P
><P
>20. To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death;</P
><P
>21. To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem;</P
><P
>22. When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the LORD.</P
><P
>23. He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.</P
><P
>24. I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thy years are throughout all generations.</P
><P
>25. Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</P
><P
>26. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed:</P
><P
>27. But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.</P
><P
>28. The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed shall be established before thee.</P
