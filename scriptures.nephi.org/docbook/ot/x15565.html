>19.38. Chapter 38</H1
><P
>1. O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</P
><P
>2. For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.</P
><P
>3. There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.</P
><P
>4. For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me.</P
><P
>5. My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.</P
><P
>6. I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</P
><P
>7. For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is no soundness in my flesh.</P
><P
>8. I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</P
><P
>9. Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.</P
><P
>10. My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me.</P
><P
>11. My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.</P
><P
>12. They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long.</P
><P
>13. But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.</P
><P
>14. Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.</P
><P
>15. For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.</P
><P
>16. For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.</P
><P
>17. For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.</P
><P
>18. For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.</P
><P
>19. But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.</P
><P
>20. They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.</P
><P
>21. Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.</P
><P
>22. Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.</P
