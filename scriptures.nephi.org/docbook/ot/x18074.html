>20.13. Chapter 13</H1
><P
>1. A WISE son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner heareth not rebuke.</P
><P
>2. A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul of the transgressors shall eat violence.</P
><P
>3. He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.</P
><P
>4. The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the soul of the diligent shall be made fat.</P
><P
>5. A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome, and cometh to shame.</P
><P
>6. Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but wickedness overthroweth the sinner.</P
><P
>7. There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.</P
><P
>8. The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor heareth not rebuke.</P
><P
>9. The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the wicked shall be put out.</P
><P
>10. Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is wisdom.</P
><P
>11. Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that gathereth by labour shall increase.</P
><P
>12. Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire cometh, it is a tree of life.</P
><P
>13. Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.</P
><P
>14. The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</P
><P
>15. Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard.</P
><P
>16. Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth open his folly.</P
><P
>17. A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful ambassador is health.</P
><P
>18. Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction: but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.</P
><P
>19. The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is abomination to fools to depart from evil.</P
><P
>20. He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</P
><P
>21. Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be repayed.</P
><P
>22. A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children: and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.</P
><P
>23. Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is destroyed for want of judgment.</P
><P
>24. He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes.</P
><P
>25. The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the belly of the wicked shall want.</P
