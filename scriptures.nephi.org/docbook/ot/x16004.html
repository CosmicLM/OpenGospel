>19.66. Chapter 66</H1
><P
>1. MAKE a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:</P
><P
>2. Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.</P
><P
>3. Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works!  through the greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves unto thee.</P
><P
>4. All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name.  Selah.</P
><P
>5. Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing toward the children of men.</P
><P
>6. He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood on foot: there did we rejoice in him.</P
><P
>7. He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: let not the rebellious exalt themselves.  Selah.</P
><P
>8. O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard:</P
><P
>9. Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.</P
><P
>10. For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver is tried.</P
><P
>11. Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon our loins.</P
><P
>12. Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place.</P
><P
>13. I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee my vows,</P
><P
>14. Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble.</P
><P
>15. I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats.  Selah.</P
><P
>16. Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul.</P
><P
>17. I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my tongue.</P
><P
>18. If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:</P
><P
>19. But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer.</P
><P
>20. Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me.</P
