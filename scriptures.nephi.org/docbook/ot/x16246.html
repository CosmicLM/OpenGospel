>19.77. Chapter 77</H1
><P
>1. I CRIED unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.</P
><P
>2. In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.</P
><P
>3. I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed.  Selah.</P
><P
>4. Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</P
><P
>5. I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</P
><P
>6. I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.</P
><P
>7. Will the Lord cast off for ever?  and will he be favourable no more?</P
><P
>8. Is his mercy clean gone for ever?  doth his promise fail for evermore?</P
><P
>9. Hath God forgotten to be gracious?  hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?  Selah.</P
><P
>10. And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High.</P
><P
>11. I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember thy wonders of old.</P
><P
>12. I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.</P
><P
>13. Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as our God?</P
><P
>14. Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy strength among the people.</P
><P
>15. Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.  Selah.</P
><P
>16. The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid: the depths also were troubled.</P
><P
>17. The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine arrows also went abroad.</P
><P
>18. The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.</P
><P
>19. Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</P
><P
>20. Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.</P
