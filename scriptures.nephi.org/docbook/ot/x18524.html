>20.27. Chapter 27</H1
><P
>1. BOAST not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth.</P
><P
>2. Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a stranger, and not thine own lips.</P
><P
>3. A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is heavier than them both.</P
><P
>4. Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to stand before envy?</P
><P
>5. Open rebuke is better than secret love.</P
><P
>6. Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful.</P
><P
>7. The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul every bitter thing is sweet.</P
><P
>8. As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.</P
><P
>9. Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness of a man's friend by hearty counsel.</P
><P
>10. Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.</P
><P
>11. My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that reproacheth me.</P
><P
>12. A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the simple pass on, and are punished.</P
><P
>13. Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.</P
><P
>14. He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.</P
><P
>15. A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.</P
><P
>16. Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.</P
><P
>17. Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.</P
><P
>18. Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.</P
><P
>19. As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.</P
><P
>20. Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.</P
><P
>21. As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man to his praise.</P
><P
>22. Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.</P
><P
>23. Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.</P
><P
>24. For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation?</P
><P
>25. The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.</P
><P
>26. The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.</P
><P
>27. And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.</P
