>20.14. Chapter 14</H1
><P
>1. EVERY wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh it down with her hands.</P
><P
>2. He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.</P
><P
>3. In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of the wise shall preserve them.</P
><P
>4. Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by the strength of the ox.</P
><P
>5. A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will utter lies.</P
><P
>6. A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is easy unto him that understandeth.</P
><P
>7. Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.</P
><P
>8. The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the folly of fools is deceit.</P
><P
>9. Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is favour.</P
><P
>10. The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.</P
><P
>11. The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.</P
><P
>12. There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.</P
><P
>13. Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.</P
><P
>14. The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and a good man shall be satisfied from himself.</P
><P
>15. The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh well to his going.</P
><P
>16. A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool rageth, and is confident.</P
><P
>17. He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked devices is hated.</P
><P
>18. The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with knowledge.</P
><P
>19. The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.</P
><P
>20. The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath many friends.</P
><P
>21. He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath mercy on the poor, happy is he.</P
><P
>22. Do they not err that devise evil?  but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.</P
><P
>23. In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips tendeth only to penury.</P
><P
>24. The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of fools is folly.</P
><P
>25. A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness speaketh lies.</P
><P
>26. In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children shall have a place of refuge.</P
><P
>27. The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.</P
><P
>28. In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the want of people is the destruction of the prince.</P
><P
>29. He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.</P
><P
>30. A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the rottenness of the bones.</P
><P
>31. He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.</P
><P
>32. The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous hath hope in his death.</P
><P
>33. Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding: but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.</P
><P
>34. Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any people.</P
><P
>35. The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is against him that causeth shame.</P
