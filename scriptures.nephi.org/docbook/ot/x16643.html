>1. O COME, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation.</P
><P
>2. Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise unto him with psalms.</P
><P
>3. For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.</P
><P
>4. In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of the hills is his also.</P
><P
>5. The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.</P
><P
>6. O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORD our maker.</P
><P
>7. For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.  To day if ye will hear his voice,</P
><P
>8. Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness:</P
><P
>9. When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.</P
><P
>10. Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways:</P
><P
>11. Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest.</P
