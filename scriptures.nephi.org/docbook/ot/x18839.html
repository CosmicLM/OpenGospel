>21.8. Chapter 8</H1
><P
>1. WHO is as the wise man?  and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing?  a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.</P
><P
>2. I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</P
><P
>3. Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.</P
><P
>4. Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say unto him, What doest thou?</P
><P
>5. Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.</P
><P
>6. ¶ Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.</P
><P
>7. For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him when it shall be?</P
><P
>8. There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver those that are given to it.</P
><P
>9. All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man ruleth over another to his own hurt.</P
><P
>10. And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done: this is also vanity.</P
><P
>11. Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</P
><P
>12. ¶ Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him:</P
><P
>13. But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.</P
><P
>14. There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also is vanity.</P
><P
>15. Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life, which God giveth him under the sun.</P
><P
>16. ¶ When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)</P
><P
>17. Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun: because though a man labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea further; though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find it.</P
