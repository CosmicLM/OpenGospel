>20.30. Chapter 30</H1
><P
>1. THE words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,</P
><P
>2. Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.</P
><P
>3. I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.</P
><P
>4. Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended?  who hath gathered the wind in his fists?  who hath bound the waters in a garment?  who hath established all the ends of the earth?  what is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?</P
><P
>5. Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.</P
><P
>6. Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.</P
><P
>7. Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:</P
><P
>8. Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:</P
><P
>9. Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD?  or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</P
><P
>10. Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.</P
><P
>11. There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not bless their mother.</P
><P
>12. There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.</P
><P
>13. There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes!  and their eyelids are lifted up.</P
><P
>14. There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.</P
><P
>15. The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not, It is enough:</P
><P
>16. The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.</P
><P
>17. The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.</P
><P
>18. There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:</P
><P
>19. The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.</P
><P
>20. Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</P
><P
>21. For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:</P
><P
>22. For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;</P
><P
>23. For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</P
><P
>24. There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:</P
><P
>25. The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;</P
><P
>26. The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;</P
><P
>27. The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;</P
><P
>28. The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.</P
><P
>29. There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in going:</P
><P
>30. A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;</P
><P
>31. A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.</P
><P
>32. If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</P
><P
>33. Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife.</P
