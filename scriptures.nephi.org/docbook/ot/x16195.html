>19.74. Chapter 74</H1
><P
>1. O GOD, why hast thou cast us off for ever?  why doth thine anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?</P
><P
>2. Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.</P
><P
>3. Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.</P
><P
>4. Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs.</P
><P
>5. A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees.</P
><P
>6. But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</P
><P
>7. They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.</P
><P
>8. They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</P
><P
>9. We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</P
><P
>10. O God, how long shall the adversary reproach?  shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</P
><P
>11. Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand?  pluck it out of thy bosom.</P
><P
>12. For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth.</P
><P
>13. Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters.</P
><P
>14. Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</P
><P
>15. Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty rivers.</P
><P
>16. The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</P
><P
>17. Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.</P
><P
>18. Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.</P
><P
>19. O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.</P
><P
>20. Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.</P
><P
>21. O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy praise thy name.</P
><P
>22. Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish man reproacheth thee daily.</P
><P
>23. Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually.</P
