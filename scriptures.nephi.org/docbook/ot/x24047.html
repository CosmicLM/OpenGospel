>28.11. Chapter 11</H1
><P
>1. WHEN Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.</P
><P
>2. As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.</P
><P
>3. I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.</P
><P
>4. I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I laid meat unto them.</P
><P
>5. ¶ He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.</P
><P
>6. And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.</P
><P
>7. And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.</P
><P
>8. How shall I give thee up, Ephraim?  how shall I deliver thee, Israel?  how shall I make thee as Admah?  how shall I set thee as Zeboim?  mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.</P
><P
>9. I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.</P
><P
>10. They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion: when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the west.</P
><P
>11. They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses, saith the LORD.</P
><P
>12. Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful with the saints.</P
