>20.5. Chapter 5</H1
><P
>1. MY son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:</P
><P
>2. That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.</P
><P
>3. ¶ For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:</P
><P
>4. But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.</P
><P
>5. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</P
><P
>6. Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are moveable, that thou canst not know them.</P
><P
>7. Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</P
><P
>8. Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:</P
><P
>9. Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:</P
><P
>10. Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;</P
><P
>11. And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,</P
><P
>12. And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;</P
><P
>13. And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me!</P
><P
>14. I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.</P
><P
>15. ¶ Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.</P
><P
>16. Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.</P
><P
>17. Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.</P
><P
>18. Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy youth.</P
><P
>19. Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</P
><P
>20. And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?</P
><P
>21. For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</P
><P
>22. ¶ His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.</P
><P
>23. He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.</P
