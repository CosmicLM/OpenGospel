>18.27. Chapter 27</H1
><P
>1. MOREOVER Job continued his parable, and said,</P
><P
>2. As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;</P
><P
>3. All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils;</P
><P
>4. My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter deceit.</P
><P
>5. God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not remove mine integrity from me.</P
><P
>6. My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.</P
><P
>7. Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against me as the unrighteous.</P
><P
>8. For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained, when God taketh away his soul?</P
><P
>9. Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?</P
><P
>10. Will he delight himself in the Almighty?  will he always call upon God?</P
><P
>11. I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.</P
><P
>12. Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus altogether vain?</P
><P
>13. This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.</P
><P
>14. If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.</P
><P
>15. Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his widows shall not weep.</P
><P
>16. Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as the clay;</P
><P
>17. He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the innocent shall divide the silver.</P
><P
>18. He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keeper maketh.</P
><P
>19. The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he openeth his eyes, and he is not.</P
><P
>20. Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him away in the night.</P
><P
>21. The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a storm hurleth him out of his place.</P
><P
>22. For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee out of his hand.</P
><P
>23. Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of his place.</P
