>20.18. Chapter 18</H1
><P
>1. THROUGH desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and intermeddleth with all wisdom.</P
><P
>2. A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</P
><P
>3. When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with ignominy reproach.</P
><P
>4. The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.</P
><P
>5. It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to overthrow the righteous in judgment.</P
><P
>6. A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</P
><P
>7. A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</P
><P
>8. The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into the innermost parts of the belly.</P
><P
>9. He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is a great waster.</P
><P
>10. The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</P
><P
>11. The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall in his own conceit.</P
><P
>12. Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before honour is humility.</P
><P
>13. He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.</P
><P
>14. The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded spirit who can bear?</P
><P
>15. The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the wise seeketh knowledge.</P
><P
>16. A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before great men.</P
><P
>17. He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his neighbour cometh and searcheth him.</P
><P
>18. The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the mighty.</P
><P
>19. A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and their contentions are like the bars of a castle.</P
><P
>20. A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth; and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.</P
><P
>21. Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof.</P
><P
>22. Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favour of the LORD.</P
><P
>23. The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.</P
><P
>24. A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.</P
