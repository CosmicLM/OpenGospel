>18.9. Chapter 9</H1
><P
>1. THEN Job answered and said,</P
><P
>2. I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with God?</P
><P
>3. If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a thousand.</P
><P
>4. He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened himself against him, and hath prospered?</P
><P
>5. Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.</P
><P
>6. Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereof tremble.</P
><P
>7. Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up the stars.</P
><P
>8. Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of the sea.</P
><P
>9. Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers of the south.</P
><P
>10. Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number.</P
><P
>11. Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but I perceive him not.</P
><P
>12. Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him?  who will say unto him, What doest thou?</P
><P
>13. If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop under him.</P
><P
>14. How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to reason with him?</P
><P
>15. Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I would make supplication to my judge.</P
><P
>16. If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.</P
><P
>17. For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds without cause.</P
><P
>18. He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with bitterness.</P
><P
>19. If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, who shall set me a time to plead?</P
><P
>20. If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.</P
><P
>21. Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would despise my life.</P
><P
>22. This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfect and the wicked.</P
><P
>23. If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of the innocent.</P
><P
>24. The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth the faces of the judges thereof, if not, where, and who is he?</P
><P
>25. Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.</P
><P
>26. They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that hasteth to the prey.</P
><P
>27. If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my heaviness, and comfort myself:</P
><P
>28. I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold me innocent.</P
><P
>29. If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?</P
><P
>30. If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so clean;</P
><P
>31. Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.</P
><P
>32. For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we should come together in judgment.</P
><P
>33. Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his hand upon us both.</P
><P
>34. Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrify me:</P
><P
>35. Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with me.</P
