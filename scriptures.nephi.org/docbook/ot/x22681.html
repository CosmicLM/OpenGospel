>26.22. Chapter 22</H1
><P
>1. MOREOVER the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</P
><P
>2. Now, thou son of man, wilt thou judge, wilt thou judge the bloody city?  yea, thou shalt shew her all her abominations.</P
><P
>3. Then say thou, Thus saith the Lord GOD, The city sheddeth blood in the midst of it, that her time may come, and maketh idols against herself to defile herself.</P
><P
>4. Thou art become guilty in thy blood that thou hast shed; and hast defiled thyself in thine idols which thou hast made; and thou hast caused thy days to draw near, and art come even unto thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach unto the heathen, and a mocking to all countries.</P
><P
>5. Those that be near, and those that be far from thee, shall mock thee, which art infamous and much vexed.</P
><P
>6. Behold, the princes of Israel, every one were in thee to their power to shed blood.</P
><P
>7. In thee have they set light by father and mother: in the midst of thee have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in thee have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.</P
><P
>8. Thou hast despised mine holy things, and hast profaned my sabbaths.</P
><P
>9. In thee are men that carry tales to shed blood: and in thee they eat upon the mountains: in the midst of thee they commit lewdness.</P
><P
>10. In thee have they discovered their fathers' nakedness: in thee have they humbled her that was set apart for pollution.</P
><P
>11. And one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife; and another hath lewdly defiled his daughter in law; and another in thee hath humbled his sister, his father's daughter.</P
><P
>12. In thee have they taken gifts to shed blood; thou hast taken usury and increase, and thou hast greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and hast forgotten me, saith the Lord GOD.</P
><P
>13. ¶ Behold, therefore I have smitten mine hand at thy dishonest gain which thou hast made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midst of thee.</P
><P
>14. Can thine heart endure, or can thine hands be strong, in the days that I shall deal with thee?  I the LORD have spoken it, and will do it.</P
><P
>15. And I will scatter thee among the heathen, and disperse thee in the countries, and will consume thy filthiness out of thee.</P
><P
>16. And thou shalt take thine inheritance in thyself in the sight of the heathen, and thou shalt know that I am the LORD.</P
><P
>17. And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</P
><P
>18. Son of man, the house of Israel is to me become dross: all they are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace; they are even the dross of silver.</P
><P
>19. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye are all become dross, behold, therefore I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem.</P
><P
>20. As they gather silver, and brass, and iron, and lead, and tin, into the midst of the furnace, to blow the fire upon it, to melt it; so will I gather you in mine anger and in my fury, and I will leave you there, and melt you.</P
><P
>21. Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be melted in the midst thereof.</P
><P
>22. As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst thereof; and ye shall know that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you.</P
><P
>23. ¶ And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,</P
><P
>24. Son of man, say unto her, Thou art the land that is not cleansed, nor rained upon in the day of indignation.</P
><P
>25. There is a conspiracy of her prophets in the midst thereof, like a roaring lion ravening the prey; they have devoured souls; they have taken the treasure and precious things; they have made her many widows in the midst thereof.</P
><P
>26. Her priests have violated my law, and have profaned mine holy things: they have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they shewed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.</P
><P
>27. Her princes in the midst thereof are like wolves ravening the prey, to shed blood, and to destroy souls, to get dishonest gain.</P
><P
>28. And her prophets have daubed them with untempered morter, seeing vanity, and divining lies unto them, saying, Thus saith the Lord GOD, when the LORD hath not spoken.</P
><P
>29. The people of the land have used oppression, and exercised robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppressed the stranger wrongfully.</P
><P
>30. And I sought for a man among them, that should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I found none.</P
><P
>31. Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them; I have consumed them with the fire of my wrath: their own way have I recompensed upon their heads, saith the Lord GOD.</P
