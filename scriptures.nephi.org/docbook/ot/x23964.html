>28.6. Chapter 6</H1
><P
>1. COME, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.</P
><P
>2. After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.</P
><P
>3. Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.</P
><P
>4. ¶ O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee?  O Judah, what shall I do unto thee?  for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.</P
><P
>5. Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light that goeth forth.</P
><P
>6. For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.</P
><P
>7. But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have they dealt treacherously against me.</P
><P
>8. Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.</P
><P
>9. And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit lewdness.</P
><P
>10. I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.</P
><P
>11. Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.</P
