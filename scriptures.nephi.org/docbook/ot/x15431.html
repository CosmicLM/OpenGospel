>19.33. Chapter 33</H1
><P
>1. REJOICE in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for the upright.</P
><P
>2. Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and an instrument of ten strings.</P
><P
>3. Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.</P
><P
>4. For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done in truth.</P
><P
>5. He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the goodness of the LORD.</P
><P
>6. By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth.</P
><P
>7. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layeth up the depth in storehouses.</P
><P
>8. Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him.</P
><P
>9. For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.</P
><P
>10. The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he maketh the devices of the people of none effect.</P
><P
>11. The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.</P
><P
>12. Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD: and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.</P
><P
>13. The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.</P
><P
>14. From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth.</P
><P
>15. He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their works.</P
><P
>16. There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty man is not delivered by much strength.</P
><P
>17. An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.</P
><P
>18. Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy;</P
><P
>19. To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine.</P
><P
>20. Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.</P
><P
>21. For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.</P
><P
>22. Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.</P
