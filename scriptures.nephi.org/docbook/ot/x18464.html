>20.25. Chapter 25</H1
><P
>1. THESE are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied out.</P
><P
>2. It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.</P
><P
>3. The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart of kings is unsearchable.</P
><P
>4. Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come forth a vessel for the finer.</P
><P
>5. Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne shall be established in righteousness.</P
><P
>6. Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand not in the place of great men:</P
><P
>7. For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither; than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the prince whom thine eyes have seen.</P
><P
>8. Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.</P
><P
>9. Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not a secret to another:</P
><P
>10. Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy turn not away.</P
><P
>11. A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.</P
><P
>12. As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a wise reprover upon an obedient ear.</P
><P
>13. As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of his masters.</P
><P
>14. Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind without rain.</P
><P
>15. By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue breaketh the bone.</P
><P
>16. Hast thou found honey?  eat so much as is sufficient for thee, lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.</P
><P
>17. Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary of thee, and so hate thee.</P
><P
>18. A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.</P
><P
>19. Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.</P
><P
>20. As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy heart.</P
><P
>21. If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be thirsty, give him water to drink:</P
><P
>22. For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD shall reward thee.</P
><P
>23. The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue.</P
><P
>24. It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman and in a wide house.</P
><P
>25. As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country.</P
><P
>26. A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.</P
><P
>27. It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their own glory is not glory.</P
><P
>28. He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that is broken down, and without walls.</P
