>20.28. Chapter 28</H1
><P
>1. THE wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.</P
><P
>2. For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.</P
><P
>3. A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.</P
><P
>4. They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.</P
><P
>5. Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.</P
><P
>6. Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.</P
><P
>7. Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.</P
><P
>8. He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.</P
><P
>9. He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination.</P
><P
>10. Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.</P
><P
>11. The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.</P
><P
>12. When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.</P
><P
>13. He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.</P
><P
>14. Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.</P
><P
>15. As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.</P
><P
>16. The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.</P
><P
>17. A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.</P
><P
>18. Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.</P
><P
>19. He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.</P
><P
>20. A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.</P
><P
>21. To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.</P
><P
>22. He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.</P
><P
>23. He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.</P
><P
>24. Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.</P
><P
>25. He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.</P
><P
>26. He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.</P
><P
>27. He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.</P
><P
>28. When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.</P
