><P
>1. THE word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</P
><P
>2. Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.  Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?</P
><P
>3. Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their children, and their children another generation.</P
><P
>4. That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.</P
><P
>5. Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.</P
><P
>6. For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a great lion.</P
><P
>7. He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.</P
><P
>8. ¶ Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth.</P
><P
>9. The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.</P
><P
>10. The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.</P
><P
>11. Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is perished.</P
><P
>12. The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from the sons of men.</P
><P
>13. Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the house of your God.</P
><P
>14. ¶ Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God, and cry unto the LORD,</P
><P
>15. Alas for the day!  for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</P
><P
>16. Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness from the house of our God?</P
><P
>17. The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.</P
><P
>18. How do the beasts groan!  the herds of cattle are perplexed, because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made desolate.</P
><P
>19. O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field.</P
><P
>20. The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</P
