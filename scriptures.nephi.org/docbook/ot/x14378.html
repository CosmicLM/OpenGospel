>1. THEN Job answered and said,</P
><P
>2. Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.</P
><P
>3. Oh that I knew where I might find him!  that I might come even to his seat!</P
><P
>4. I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with arguments.</P
><P
>5. I would know the words which he would answer me, and understand what he would say unto me.</P
><P
>6. Will he plead against me with his great power?  No; but he would put strength in me.</P
><P
>7. There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge.</P
><P
>8. Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I cannot perceive him:</P
><P
>9. On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:</P
><P
>10. But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold.</P
><P
>11. My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined.</P
><P
>12. Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.</P
><P
>13. But he is in one mind, and who can turn him?  and what his soul desireth, even that he doeth.</P
><P
>14. For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many such things are with him.</P
><P
>15. Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am afraid of him.</P
><P
>16. For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:</P
><P
>17. Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he covered the darkness from my face.</P
