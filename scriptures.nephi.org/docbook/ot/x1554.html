>1.48. Chapter 48</H1
><P
>1. AND it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph, Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.</P
><P
>2. And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed.</P
><P
>3. And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</P
><P
>4. And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</P
><P
>5. ¶ And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</P
><P
>6. And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in their inheritance.</P
><P
>7. And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath; the same is Beth-lehem.</P
><P
>8. And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</P
><P
>9. And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place.  And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</P
><P
>10. Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see.  And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them.</P
><P
>11. And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</P
><P
>12. And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</P
><P
>13. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.</P
><P
>14. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn.</P
><P
>15. ¶ And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life long unto this day.</P
><P
>16. The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</P
><P
>17. And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto Manasseh's head.</P
><P
>18. And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</P
><P
>19. And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</P
><P
>20. And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</P
><P
>21. And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</P
><P
>22. Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.</P
