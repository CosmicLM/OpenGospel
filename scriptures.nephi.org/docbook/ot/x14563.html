>18.31. Chapter 31</H1
><P
>1. I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon a maid?</P
><P
>2. For what portion of God is there from above?  and what inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</P
><P
>3. Is not destruction to the wicked?  and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?</P
><P
>4. Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?</P
><P
>5. If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit;</P
><P
>6. Let me be weighed in an even balance, that God may know mine integrity.</P
><P
>7. If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;</P
><P
>8. Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.</P
><P
>9. If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid wait at my neighbour's door;</P
><P
>10. Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down upon her.</P
><P
>11. For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be punished by the judges.</P
><P
>12. For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root out all mine increase.</P
><P
>13. If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my maidservant, when they contended with me;</P
><P
>14. What then shall I do when God riseth up?  and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?</P
><P
>15. Did not he that made me in the womb make him?  and did not one fashion us in the womb?</P
><P
>16. If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail;</P
><P
>17. Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof;</P
><P
>18. (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)</P
><P
>19. If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;</P
><P
>20. If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep;</P
><P
>21. If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw my help in the gate:</P
><P
>22. Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.</P
><P
>23. For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of his highness I could not endure.</P
><P
>24. If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thou art my confidence;</P
><P
>25. If I rejoiced because my wealth was great, and because mine hand had gotten much;</P
><P
>26. If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness;</P
><P
>27. And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand:</P
><P
>28. This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above.</P
><P
>29. If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me, or lifted up myself when evil found him:</P
><P
>30. Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to his soul.</P
><P
>31. If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his flesh!  we cannot be satisfied.</P
><P
>32. The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doors to the traveller.</P
><P
>33. If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquity in my bosom:</P
><P
>34. Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?</P
><P
>35. Oh that one would hear me!  behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.</P
><P
>36. Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me.</P
><P
>37. I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince would I go near unto him.</P
><P
>38. If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereof complain;</P
><P
>39. If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have caused the owners thereof to lose their life:</P
><P
>40. Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.  The words of Job are ended.</P
