>20.19. Chapter 19</H1
><P
>1. BETTER is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.</P
><P
>2. Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.</P
><P
>3. The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.</P
><P
>4. Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.</P
><P
>5. A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.</P
><P
>6. Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.</P
><P
>7. All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him?  he pursueth them with words, yet they are wanting to him.</P
><P
>8. He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.</P
><P
>9. A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.</P
><P
>10. Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.</P
><P
>11. The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his glory to pass over a transgression.</P
><P
>12. The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.</P
><P
>13. A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.</P
><P
>14. House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent wife is from the LORD.</P
><P
>15. Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall suffer hunger.</P
><P
>16. He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he that despiseth his ways shall die.</P
><P
>17. He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and that which he hath given will he pay him again.</P
><P
>18. Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his crying.</P
><P
>19. A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou deliver him, yet thou must do it again.</P
><P
>20. Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be wise in thy latter end.</P
><P
>21. There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.</P
><P
>22. The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better than a liar.</P
><P
>23. The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.</P
><P
>24. A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so much as bring it to his mouth again.</P
><P
>25. Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.</P
><P
>26. He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.</P
><P
>27. Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err from the words of knowledge.</P
><P
>28. An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the wicked devoureth iniquity.</P
><P
>29. Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back of fools.</P
