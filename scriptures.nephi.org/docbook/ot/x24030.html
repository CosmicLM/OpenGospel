>28.10. Chapter 10</H1
><P
>1. ISRAEL is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.</P
><P
>2. Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.</P
><P
>3. For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?</P
><P
>4. They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant: thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the field.</P
><P
>5. The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Beth-aven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof, because it is departed from it.</P
><P
>6. It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be ashamed of his own counsel.</P
><P
>7. As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.</P
><P
>8. The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to the hills, Fall on us.</P
><P
>9. O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.</P
><P
>10. It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.</P
><P
>11. And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall break his clods.</P
><P
>12. Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness upon you.</P
><P
>13. Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way, in the multitude of thy mighty men.</P
><P
>14. Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her children.</P
><P
>15. So shall Beth-el do unto you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.</P
