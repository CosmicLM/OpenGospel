>19.9. Chapter 9</H1
><P
>1. I WILL praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.</P
><P
>2. I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.</P
><P
>3. When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.</P
><P
>4. For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.</P
><P
>5. Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.</P
><P
>6. O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.</P
><P
>7. But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.</P
><P
>8. And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.</P
><P
>9. The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.</P
><P
>10. And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</P
><P
>11. Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare among the people his doings.</P
><P
>12. When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.</P
><P
>13. Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:</P
><P
>14. That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.</P
><P
>15. The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</P
><P
>16. The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands.  Higgaion.  Selah.</P
><P
>17. The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.</P
><P
>18. For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall not perish for ever.</P
><P
>19. Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged in thy sight.</P
><P
>20. Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves to be but men.  Selah.</P
