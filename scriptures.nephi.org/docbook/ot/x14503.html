>18.29. Chapter 29</H1
><P
>1. MOREOVER Job continued his parable, and said,</P
><P
>2. Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God preserved me;</P
><P
>3. When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked through darkness;</P
><P
>4. As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was upon my tabernacle;</P
><P
>5. When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about me;</P
><P
>6. When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil;</P
><P
>7. When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!</P
><P
>8. The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, and stood up.</P
><P
>9. The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.</P
><P
>10. The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth.</P
><P
>11. When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye saw me, it gave witness to me:</P
><P
>12. Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.</P
><P
>13. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</P
><P
>14. I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as a robe and a diadem.</P
><P
>15. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.</P
><P
>16. I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I searched out.</P
><P
>17. And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out of his teeth.</P
><P
>18. Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand.</P
><P
>19. My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all night upon my branch.</P
><P
>20. My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.</P
><P
>21. Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my counsel.</P
><P
>22. After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped upon them.</P
><P
>23. And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their mouth wide as for the latter rain.</P
><P
>24. If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of my countenance they cast not down.</P
><P
>25. I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.</P
