>1. BUT Job answered and said,</P
><P
>2. How hast thou helped him that is without power?  how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?</P
><P
>3. How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom?  and how hast thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?</P
><P
>4. To whom hast thou uttered words?  and whose spirit came from thee?</P
><P
>5. Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.</P
><P
>6. Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.</P
><P
>7. He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing.</P
><P
>8. He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is not rent under them.</P
><P
>9. He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloud upon it.</P
><P
>10. He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and night come to an end.</P
><P
>11. The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.</P
><P
>12. He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth through the proud.</P
><P
>13. By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent.</P
><P
>14. Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is heard of him?  but the thunder of his power who can understand?</P
