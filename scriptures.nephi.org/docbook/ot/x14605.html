>18.32. Chapter 32</H1
><P
>1. SO these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes.</P
><P
>2. Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.</P
><P
>3. Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.</P
><P
>4. Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elder than he.</P
><P
>5. When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, then his wrath was kindled.</P
><P
>6. And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine opinion.</P
><P
>7. I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach wisdom.</P
><P
>8. But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding.</P
><P
>9. Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand judgment.</P
><P
>10. Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.</P
><P
>11. Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons, whilst ye searched out what to say.</P
><P
>12. Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you that convinced Job, or that answered his words:</P
><P
>13. Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.</P
><P
>14. Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I answer him with your speeches.</P
><P
>15. They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.</P
><P
>16. When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and answered no more;)</P
><P
>17. I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine opinion.</P
><P
>18. For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.</P
><P
>19. Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to burst like new bottles.</P
><P
>20. I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and answer.</P
><P
>21. Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let me give flattering titles unto man.</P
><P
>22. For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker would soon take me away.</P
