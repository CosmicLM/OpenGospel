>19.50. Chapter 50</H1
><P
>1. THE mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.</P
><P
>2. Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.</P
><P
>3. Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.</P
><P
>4. He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his people.</P
><P
>5. Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice.</P
><P
>6. And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judge himself.  Selah.</P
><P
>7. Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.</P
><P
>8. I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt offerings, to have been continually before me.</P
><P
>9. I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thy folds.</P
><P
>10. For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills.</P
><P
>11. I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of the field are mine.</P
><P
>12. If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.</P
><P
>13. Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?</P
><P
>14. Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most High:</P
><P
>15. And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me.</P
><P
>16. But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?</P
><P
>17. Seeing thou hatest instruction, and castest my words behind thee.</P
><P
>18. When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers.</P
><P
>19. Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.</P
><P
>20. Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest thine own mother's son.</P
><P
>21. These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.</P
><P
>22. Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</P
><P
>23. Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.</P
